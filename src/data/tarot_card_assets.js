	[{"image_path":"343px-RWS_Tarot_00_Fool.jpg","description":"Without the notion of Zero, our system of mathematics becomes meaningless. Similarly, the Fool is an essential part of the Tarot because he is the spark that sets everything else into motion, the divine breath that gives life and inspires the first step towards fulfillment and completion. Though the first step down a long path may often seem small in comparison to the journey, that first step is vital because without it there would be no journey at all! The Fool is the cause behind all effects, the power behind all manifestations and the seeds of the end sown in every beginning.@@br@@ The Fool is unmoulded potential, pure and innocent, neither positive nor negative yet containing the possibility of both. He is the unconditioned soul about to come into manifestation for the first time to start learning the lessons of the world. Though everyone calls him a Fool, he does not pay them any attention, and he simply goes on his way. Certainly what they say can be justified, since his ignorance of the world can lead him to do things that more experienced people would never imagine. But in these things he can find knowledge and enlightenment. He does not care what others think or say about him, because he knows that what he is doing is right for him.@@br@@ His approach to life is a strange, unconventional one, because he does what is comfortable to him. This is a viewpoint not often supported in our modern world, in which \do as I say\ is the commandment most followed. To those who have lived their life under this philosophy, the approach of the Fool may be extravagant, shocking, even frightening. But this approach is all that the Fool knows, and because the only approval he requires is his own, he will continue to live this way, despite what all others think of him. He has total faith in himself. Perhaps he is not such a fool after all.@@br@@ The Fool does not hide himself from the light, because he is the light - the wonderful light that shines out of every child before they see the world and are forced to build so many walls and barriers to protect themselves. The innocence of a child, sadly, is something rarely found outside of children, even though a lot of people could use it these days. With this innocence comes perfect trust, fearlessness in others, and total self-reliance. It allows you to see the world with new eyes and learn new things every day of your life. Think of how much better the world would be if everybody acted this way! It's a shame that only children, and the Fool, see this light. @@br@@ The Fool almost always stands for new beginnings, new experiences and new choices; the first steps along a new path and the first words written onto a blank page. Like the Aces of the Minor Arcana, such beginnings are like the Fool himself - neither positive nor negative, but with the potential to turn into either, depending on the choices you make and the path you follow. But this must not be your concern, because when a journey begins no one can know (or should know) what will happen on the way to the destination. Never let another person control your life. Live in the present and trust in your own abilities - this is the way of the Fool.@@br@@ Such journeys always imply a degree of risk, and hence the Fool is pictured walking toward the edge of a high cliff. With any new experience there is always the risk of failure and the certainty of change; it is the degree of change, and how that change will appear, that are undeterminable. But the Fool has no qualms about taking chances, so why should you? It is through the first steps that we learn how to walk, and it is through changes that we learn how to live our lives in harmony and peace. So jump head first into the abyss of the unknown, and know that even if you eventually fall to the ground, for a while you will soar. @@br@@ "},
{"image_path":"345px-RWS_Tarot_02_High_Priestess.jpg","description":"The High Priestess is arguably the most difficult of the Major Arcana to qualify with words alone, because so much of her power and ability is veiled in mystery that it is difficult for anyone to fathom it all. Every card in the Tarot speaks differently to everyone, but the Priestess seems to bear the widest range of interpretations, because she speaks directly to the Inner Voice, the unconscious mind. She is the manifestation of the unconscious and the effects of the mysterious in our everyday world. Trying to see how such mysteries work often defeats their purpose, and with this in mind, the High Priestess will be explained in as much detail as possible.@@br@@ She is, above all else, the base of potential that is the source of the power wielded by the Magician. She is the unlimited potential that allows him to transform and create whatever his Will desires. Understanding this type of balance, as found between potential and creation, masculine and feminine, is the key to unlocking some of the mysteries of the High Priestess. We see the clear progression of the theme of balance; instead of integrating opposites, the Priestess keeps them separate and keeps them in balance nonetheles. She herself is the scales; this symbolism is found in many Tarot decks. Without this balance there can be no power.@@br@@ The second symbolic motif found in almost all instances of the High Preistess are symbols of the unconscious mind. On the Rider-Waite version this motif is especially prominent, but most decks feature at least some lunar imagery that in turn has ties to the unconscious. Most decks that have the \twin pillars\ symbology also depict a veil strung between those pillars; the High Priestess stands between us and that veil as a moderator. Behind the veil lies the powers of the unconscious, which we cannot start to understand but which, through her, we can learn to control. She is the gateway to realms that we may never fully comprehend or master.@@br@@ While it would be impossible for anyone to learn all of her mysteries and secrets, the High Priestess remains as a guide to those of us willing to venture deep within our minds to discover the true powers hidden deep inside each of us. This is the same power as that depicted on the Magician, but the scope of the Priestess' power is far different. While the Magician focuses his powers outward, to achieve a meaningful effect on the world, the High Priestess shows us that we can also use these powers on an inner level, to enrich and transform ourselves. Such transformations are certainly not as dramatic as the Magician's, but they are almost always more powerful.@@br@@ The High Priestess represents the mysteries of the unconscious and the Inner Voice, and her appearance is often a sign that your own intuition is trying to send you a message. The unconscious often speaks to us in symbols, so be alert around you for anything that seems out of the ordinary. This said, if you have an important decision to make when the Priestess appears, this is often a sign that the answers will be revealed to you, if you are patient and open to the whispers from within. You simply have to wait and be receptive to inner messages. Her lesson is that everything you need to know already exists within you.@@br@@ The theme of dualism in the High Preistess cannot be avoided either. She is often a sign of the Shadow, the negative portion of your personality that no one sees, and that you yourself could be unaware of. (In this sense, the term 'negative' does not refer to evil, just the opposite polarity from the positive and expressive part of your personality.) If you accept the Shadow within you, its powers will be open to you if you wish to use them. In most people the Shadow side is the more passive of the two, and the Priestess can therefore advocate a need for passivity in a situation. It is not always necessary to act; sometimes goals can be realized through inaction. @@br@@ "},
{"image_path":"347px-RWS_Tarot_19_Sun.jpg","description":"The Sun symbolizes many things depending on how you look at it. The ancients saw the sun as the giver of life and light, and almost every polytheistic faith has a Sun God. It brings light and clarity after a period of darkness and confusion, and in this sense the Sun God is often a redeemer as well; a bringer of peace and good times after ordeals. Finally, the Sun is a symbol of steadfastness and reliability, for no matter how bleak your situation may seem, no matter how many problems you have, the Sun will still rise in the morning. All of these attributions, and more, are reflected in the Tarot card that bears the same name as our solitary star.@@br@@ The light of the Sun is about halfway between that embodied on the Tower and that shown on the Star. It is not a blinding flash of power but neither is it a subtle glow. It is hot enough to warm but generally not enough to burn. This moderation between extremes is the goal of the spiritual traveler, first shown on Temperance, now entered into full manifestation for us all to see. In this higher state, nothing is beyond your control. In the Rider-Waite deck a powerful symbol illustrates this. The sunfowers in the garden are not turned towards the Sun, as they normally are, but to the child on the horse. He is the one who now holds power over the material world.@@br@@ The great ordeal of the Moon has passed, and you have emerged into the light, stronger and wiser. War has ended and made way for peace; hatred is replaced by love; fear is overcome by courage. This is truly a time to celebrate! Good triumphing so powerfully over evil is not an everyday occurence in this world, and when it does happen you should be glad that a little more light has entered your life. The rising of the Sun is akin to the completion of the tasks and trials of the night, and the warmth it provides is the reward for not cowering in fear at the darkness, not running away given the chance, and not trying to hide from the wisdom that is rightfully yours.@@br@@ As a sign of reliability, there is nothing more powerful than the Sun, since no force on Earth (or anywhere else for that matter) can stop the Sun from rising in the morning. In a world of chaos, it is a still point of silence and calm, an assurance that there is some underlying order, some higher power that chooses to bless us and smile upon us each day. Even when clouds fill the sky the Sun is still there, waiting for an opportunity to break through the dark barrier and shine its light for us. Know that in every challenge there is an opportunity, and behind every cloud sits a sun waiting for its chance to be revealed to all.@@br@@ In a reading the Sun can take on many meanings, though the most predominant one is that of success and completion. It can be a herald of joy, happiness, the birth of a child, a stable family, material prosperity or almost any other end that is positive - but above all it shows completion. One cycle is over and, before the next begins, there is a period of light and relaxation that you can and should properly enjoy. Success comes if you are confident and bold in the use of your creative energy. Glow with the vitality of the Sun whose light is umatched and whose power is absolute.@@br@@ Such power and clarity are within everyone's grasp, including yours, if you let the light of the Sun illuminate you. If there are areas of darkness lurking inside you, the Sun's rays will expose them so you can integrate them into yourself. Fogs of confusion are burned away with the Sun's fiery sword, and its flames drive away fear and all the terrors of the night. A seemingly hopeless situation will be hopeless no more once the Sun shines down upon the true path, the correct solution. When the Sun appears, let its power amaze and overwhelm you. But do not simply watch - reach up to grasp it, draw its power into yourself. The power of the Sun is true power indeed. @@br@@ "},
{"image_path":"Cups01.jpg","description":"Everything starts with love, so they say, and this is certainly true of the Cups suit. The Ace of Cups is the initial flow of emotion that could become a mighty river is given time and attention. It is the planted - but still dormant - seed of great love and affection in the future, the first stirrings of passion, joy and insight. The Cup on this Ace is often said to represent the Holy Grail, and just as Joseph of Arimathea was sustained by the wafer placed in the Grail each day, so too does love and emotional balance sustain our everyday lives.@@br@@ Often, the Ace of Cups will predict the start of a relationship, one that is full of potential and may eventually lead to true love and happiness. But you must always remember that the Ace can show only potential, not the final result of a situation. If a relationship starts out well, it is up to the two people involved to keep it that way, and improve upon it in any possible manner. The Ace of Cups is not a guarantee of happiness, but a guarantee that you will have the chance to make happiness for yourself if you want to. If you want to develop an existing relationship, the Ace cannot help you.@@br@@ In situations not involving relationships, the Ace of Cups still shows the power of love that is necesary in the situation. But love in this sense does not always refer to romance. Love is a plant with many flowers: generosity, forgiveness, peace, honesty or simply letting your feelings show. Ask your Inner Voice which kind of love you will need, and you will surely get an answer because the Ace of Cups is the card of the awakening intuition. All of these things associated with emotion and intuition run high when the Ace of Cups makes an appearance.@@br@@ This is indeed a very spiritual card, not only because of its ties to the intuition and its resemblance to the Holy Grail, but because it shows the first step down a path of enlightenment and understanding. This is a period where the Inner Voice will actively manifest in your life, and your hidden dreams and desires have a chance to be realized. As with the relationship issue, now is your time to pursue those amibitions if you so choose. In the best cases the Ace of Cups will represent a powerful spiritual awakening that you must accept and embrace. Allow the light of the Universe to touch you, and allow the power of love to flow out of your heart. @@br@@ "},
{"image_path":"Cups02.jpg","description":"By its image, the Two of Cups almost always suggests a relationship between two people. Indeed, this is the primary meaning of the card and the one that appears most often in readings. But the love described by this card is not always love for another person. Before we can truly love another we must learn to love ourselves, to love and accept all of the different (and often conflicting) facets of the gemstone that makes up our personality. Like the Temperance card, this is a card of harmonious union, not just of two people, but of two parts of the same person.@@br@@ That said, it remains obvious that a lot of the time the Two of Cups speaks of external relationships. This is often seen as the card of the soulmate, that person with whom we share a special connection and whom we can love unconditionally. The synergy of a person with his or her soulmate is like the meeting of two stars which, though bright when separate, shine even more brightly when together. From a distance they may even appear to be a single entitiy. Such harmonious combinations, whether they are between two people, groups or ideas, are a staple of the Two of Cups.@@br@@ It must be said, however, that this card does have its drawbacks. The energy of the Two of Cups is slightly more diluted than the Lovers card, and not simply because of the Major/Minor Arcana power drop. Whereas the Lovers is the reunion of two complete beings, the Two of Cups is a more immature union that, stable as it may seem, does have the potential to fall apart. This is an ideal union, but as you know, there are few ideal cases in our real world! It is ambiguous whether the relationship shown by the Two of Cups can stand the test of time. Only the two people involved can decide that.@@br@@ One factor in deciding the stability of a relationship is the stability of the people involved. As mentioned earlier, a high self-love will lead to a greater and more comprehensive love of others. So when this card does not appear to signal a relationship, see it as a sign that you have some work to do within yourself. If you can see the light within yourself then you cannot help showing it to others. By releasing doubt and uncertainty we become able to love others without hesitation and without regret. When you stop telling yourself what you could be, you can start enjoying what you already are. And you can let others enjoy that too. @@br@@ "},
{"image_path":"Cups03.jpg","description":"Rather than simply two forces working together towards the purposes of love and harmony, the Three of Cups represents all kinds of people or groups who work as one. The figures pictured on the Three of Cups are always joyful, celebrating some success together, and thus the card shows us that happy times spent in the company of our friends and loved one become even happier, while sad times become a little less sad. This is one of the many powers of the group, and the community as a whole, that are explored through the card called the Three of Cups.@@br@@ The influence of the community is very powerful in this card; and though each member of this community is different they can and will often work together in harmony. This card is often a sign of the true power of the group: to bring people of all ages and ways of life together, to achieve a common goal. It is a sign that you should seek out other people to celebrate your success along with you. But bear this in mind: in such groups, it is essential that everyone has common ground, but it is also important that not everyone is the same. It is similarities which bring people together; but it is differences which make them strong.@@br@@ Any occasion where people celebrate together can be indicated by the Three of Cups; including weddings, anniversaries, parties, baby showers, community festivities, etc. For the moment, even though life's problems go on, you can take time out to forget about the hassles of the everyday world and enjoy the company of your friends and loved one. Such respites are often needed before and after periods of high stress, to stop you from getting burned out emotionally or physically. When this card appears and you are in a lot of stress, take some time off to recuperate, and gain the support of friends before returning to battle.@@br@@ The sentiments expressed on this card are deep and unusual, not fully visible just from the appearance of the card. It is a kind of love that many people search for their entire lives and yet never find, while others do nothing and it seems to flow right to them. If you are one of this latter group, enjoy it as much as you can! If yo are in the first category, maybe you've been looking too hard for that which you already have. Everyone has an abundant life in his or her own way, and the appearance of the Three of Cups is a sign to count your blessings and be thankful for every one. @@br@@ "},
{"image_path":"Cups04.jpg","description":"Pleasure in excess often leads to the stagnation of that pleasure and the desire for even greater things which are simply impossible. This is the lesson of the Four of Cups, a card that urges moderation in relationships and all matters of the heart. This is an apparently good and innocent card with a nasty sting lying in wait. Usually it signals a person who is surrounded by love and devotion, totally happy with himself and the life he has made. But the danger in this situation is this: if you take love for granted, you start losing it.@@br@@ This statment makes more sense than you might think. If someone is loved for a long period of time, warmly and unconditionally, then they start to forget what it is like to be unloved and alone. And when you deliberately forget about the darkness, it makes special effort to show itself again. After all, the light cannot be truly appreciated if we have nothing to compare it with. The scary part is that you usually bring about the darkness by yourself, by taking for granted the love and affection you receive. Carelessness sets in and soon everything you cared for - and everyone that cared for you - has slipped away.@@br@@ When the Four of Cups appears it must be taken as a warning. It bears the message that there is a lot of love in your life - but that it can and will slip away if you are not careful. If you see this card and think that there isn't a lot of love in your life, it is a sign to think again. Take a good long look at your life, and you'll see how much love there is in it. Most of the time, people do not realize the abundance they live in every day. They are too concerned with what they want, and they have no time to look at their lives and see how much they already have.@@br@@ This is not to say, by any means, that you cannot strive for more in life. When you have no ambitions left, your life will start to stagnate, and you will lose interest in the things that once gave you the greatest pleasure. Having no ambition is worse than having ambitions and standards that are too lofty to reach - but not much worse. A lot of the disappointment in life comes from people who want more, but who already have all that they need. The key to overcoming this disappointment is simply to see all the good that is in your life already, and be thankful for it every day. So open up your eyes and look for yourself! @@br@@ "},
{"image_path":"Cups05.jpg","description":"Most people aren't too happy when the Five of Cups appears in a reading, and for good reason. This is a card whose meanings are quite simple: sadness, grief, disappointment and regret. Often these feelings will arise because of actions such as those pictured on the Four of Cups; taking love for granted and not valuing every person or thing in our lives that make us feel special. The Four predicted that all would be lost if nothing was taken to divert the path of events, and when this advice is not heeded, the Five of Cups becomes the inevitable result.@@br@@ The Five of Cups usually is not a sign of existing hardship, but a warning so you may change your course in time. But often you will be too late, and the saddening event will happen despite your best efforts. This can be a broken relationship, a divorce, or the loss of a friend. No matter what the event or its reasons for happening, the effect is the same. The pain fills your mind, just as the tragic scene on the card burns itself into your memory so you can't forget it. To some it would seem that there is no way out of this situation, but the Tarot always shows problems on one hand and solutions on the other. In persistence of vision lies the key to overcoming the sadness. @@br@@ This is pictured universally by a number of cups that have been spilled, but one or two that are left standing, out of sight of the grieving figure on the card. But they are well within your view if you look closely enough. While it is true that much has been lost, there is still a ray of hope because some of the cups remain full and upright. You must not pity the man on this card, and you must not pity yourself when you find yourself in his situation. After all, there is a way out of you will stop crying and open your eyes. You will have to work on it, but there it is.@@br@@ Sometimes you also have to remember that change never happens just for the sake of change. There is always a reason for the disturbance, an imbalance that must be eliminated or a wrong that must be righted. In these cases, even a disastrous change can be beneficial. A relationship without love is bound to fall apart anyway, so it may be better that it fails sooner than later. The Five of Cups tells you to be thankful for what is left, don't worry about what cannot be changed, and turn a setback into a step forward. Never let your tears stop you from seeing what is left over. @@br@@ "},
{"image_path":"Cups06.jpg","description":"This card is the only one in the Tarot that refers explicitly to the past, and of memories and good times experienced there. After losses such as those on the Five we sometimes have to take a time out to heal, to look back on the past and all the good that lies there. And during such times it's never the right thing to focus on the negative, and that's why this card is so positive and full of light. The fallen cups are now full and upright again, but with blooming flowers that cannot be spilled or washed away. Now that you have looked back, maybe now the way will be clear to look forward.@@br@@ Often, people tell others to concentrate on the present and not get stuck in the past, but this counsel only applies when a person stops looking back at his past and starts dwelling on it, wishing he could change it and make things better. There is nothing wrong with looking back at the good times for inspiration when things aren't going so well. In the midst of change and crisis, looking back at what you have endured is often a good way to assure yourself that, whatever trials lay ahead, you will meet them and you will overcome them as you overcame others. Take a look at your emotional trophy case, then go out and win another cup!@@br@@ The Six of Cups almost radiates an aura of joy, because it represents the past with all its memories, the present with all its gifts, and the future with all its wondrous opportunities. It has ties to all kinds of pleasure, particularly sexual pleasure, but it can also refer to smaller, everyday pleasures. Simple gestures of affection, such as the gift of a cup pictured on the Rider-Waite version of this card, are still meaningful despite our modern world and its frantic pace. The Six of Cups can thus signal a gift given or received, or some other similar gesture.@@br@@ Since the Six of Cups has ties to sex, it follows that it is associated with fertility, childbirth and childhood. Children are a good role model to follow when this card's energy is about. They see the world as a completely perfect place, and their hearts are totally open to experience all the myriad pleasures of the world around them. When the Six of Cups suggests a path to follow, it tells you to open your heart to all the possibilities of life. Live in quiet harmony with those around you. Live in constant peace and joy. Live in the moment, remember the past, dream for the future. @@br@@ "},
{"image_path":"Cups07.jpg","description":"The Seven of Cups often appears when a difficult choice must be made, and the image on most versions of the card reflects that. The seven cups are filled with strange and wonderful gifts... but there is always danger hidden within one or two of them to sting anyone who ventures near. Lying amidst the gems and the wreath of victory are a snake and a dragon. Sometimes you have to choose between many options, all of which may be tempting but only one of which is the best choice. At others times not all of those choices are real options at all; they are delusions of the imagination.@@br@@ This card generally shows choices and plans that have little or no basis in reality. Such things are typical of the developed imagination, and fine if they stay in the imagination. But when you try to implement those ideas in the real world you are leaving yourself open to inevitable disappointment when you realize that your vision simply does not work. The fortress has no foundation and it will fall with the first enemy attack. Some attainment is indeed possible, but like the sword of Damocles, the inevitability of defeat lingers over your head, waiting to drop and shatter all those castles you have built in the clouds.@@br@@ Temptation is another theme of this card, and with so many choices presented it would be easy to be swayed to that cup containing the snake of jealously and cunning. Since this card is of the Cups suit we get all the sexual and emotional connotations of temptation; the one-night stand, the extramarital affair, and all those other things that seem innocent and pleasurable at the time they are undertaken. But in the vast majority of cases, the pleasure gained temporarily is far outweighed by the consequences that last, in most cases, for an entire lifetime.@@br@@ In short, the Seven of Cups is a sign to be vigilant in everyday life. Be on guard against temptation, and before taking any offers be aware of all the potential ramifications. Keep a close eye on your dreams so that they do not get too farfetched and fantastic. When faced with many choices, all of which seem equally attractive, turn to your intuition for guidance. If you still don't know which to take, it might be safer to not take any of them at all! Better to leave the gems than plunge one's hand into a cup full of snakes. If your ethics are questioned, do not go against them, but stand true to your beliefs. Keep your feet on the ground, and your head out of the clouds. @@br@@ "},
{"image_path":"Cups08.jpg","description":"It is appropriate that the figure on the Rider-Waite Eight of Cups is walking near a marsh or pool, because a stagnant swamp is the best symbol for the emotional stagnation portrayed here. This happens when the flow of energy and love that pushes us forward stops, and when you simply start drifting through life on the placid ocean, waiting for the wind to return. In such times, waiting is usually not the best solution because it is unlikely that anything will get done if you just sit there. This is one of those times when you might just have to break out the paddles and row.@@br@@ Recognizing when it is time to move on, away from difficult times, is the primary theme of the Eight of Cups. Since it is a Cups card it refers mainly to relationships, those where you are giving too much and not getting nearly enough in exchange. A one-sided relationship of this type will cause you nothing but pain for as long as it lasts, and when the Eight of Cups appears in a reading relating to such a relationship, it is a powerful wake-up call that cannot be ignored. Take a look at your situation and see what can be done to balance things out a little.@@br@@ Another type of energy stagnation illustrated here is simple lethargy, the lack of motivation and desire to achieve. Such apathy generally manifests as complaining about how good the past was and how bleak the future looks. The lesson the Eight of Cups gives us in this case is this: the past is gone and it cannot be changed, so you might as well make the most of the future. You cannot go backward and you cannot stay where you are, and the time has come for you to move on. This is in many ways a card of self-discovery, urging you to pursue your true path and find something better. An old ambition may have to be abandoned but a new one will certainly arise.@@br@@ Tying into this theme, and usually fitting with the card's symbolism, is the notion that physical sacrifices must be made for spiritual growth to happen. Just look at the card again: the man walks away from his eight golden cups, neatly stacked, to the barren wasteland ahead. This represents a search for higher truth when the everyday truths of the material world are no longer sufficient to satsify the soul. In many ways the Eight of Cups is tied to the Hermit and the Hanged Man, who give up their friends and their freedom, respectively, to seek wisdom. The sacrifice intended on the Eight of Cups comes from the heart, but the wisdom earned fills the void that is created. @@br@@ "},
{"image_path":"Cups09.jpg","description":"After the difficult choices of the Seven and the stagnation of the Eight, the Cups suit starts to balance out with the Nine. One of the most positive and uplifting cards of the entire deck, the Nine of Cups shows satisfaction on all levels - emotional, physical, sensual. It is little wonder that most Tarot readers refer to this as the Wish Card, and its appearance is often taken as a sign that, whatever your heart's desire is, it shall be granted in the coming days. It may not be granted exactly as you expected but you can rest assured that you will get what you want.@@br@@ As it is a Cups card, the Nine of Cups usually refers to an emotionally fulfilling situation, such as the strengthening of a romantic bond, the solidification of a friendship or the consommation of a sexual relationship. It shows that joy and happiness are certainly within your grasp, and that you probably already have them. It is a sign to enjoy the abundance of life for as long as it lasts. Feel each of your emotions as if you had never felt any of them before. Take some time to value every person you love - and all those who love you back. See the perfection all around you.@@br@@ On a more physical level, this card signals delight and pleasure, contentment with what you have and a steady foundation for the future. Your worries are all in the past, and you can look forward to a bright future. The Nine of Cups shows excellent health, though when badly dignified it can often point to an overabundance of physical pleasure that can lead to intoxication and illness. But this is really the only caution of the Nine of Cups: enjoy life and enjoy living but don't take it too far, because pleasure without regard to the consequences is rapidly lost.@@br@@ It is rare that the Nine of Cups refers to a sense of spiritual bliss, since the cards of the spirit are the Swords. But with the Swords suit so full of strife and danger, the Nine of Cups would look out of place anywhere else but in the Cups suit. And if you think about it this makes sense, because when the pleasure and contentment of the physical plane is transferred to the spiritual level, it becomes inner peace and harmony with the Universe. The Universe is, after all, the source of all the love and pleasure that flows through the Nine of Cups into our lives. It only makes sense that we can sometimes follow that river to its source. @@br@@ "},
{"image_path":"Cups10.jpg","description":"The cynics among us might scoff at the idyllic lifestyle painted for them on the Ten of Cups, especially the rainbow of Cups draped across the sky. But this is how almost everyone pictures true love, in a sense - nothing but joy and happiness for the rest of their days. This wish is a simple one, and indeed, the existence shown on the Ten of Cups, with the rolling hills and the small house on the horizon, is a simple exitence as well. And in the midst of this simplicity, the hearts of the man and woman are filled with the love of the spirit - the simplest and greatest joy of all.@@br@@ The Ten of Cups refers to cycles completed, journeys finished and lives well lived in the company of others. Serenity and peace are in the air, and for a moment you can simply forget about all of the material troubles of the world around you. Nothing material matters here, just the eternal happiness that has been earned through trials and obstacles. This success is not a fleeting or temporary one, but a lasting peace and harmony that can truly be enjoyed. There are no regrets over the past, no concerns for the future, so you can live in the moment and seize the day.@@br@@ The only caution of the Ten of Cups is to not squander these precious times that have been given to you. Don't take your happiness for granted because, as we saw on the Four of Cups, it will only slip away. Don't let this time stagnate like on the Eight of Cups, but keep it in a constant state of growth and rejuvenation. Don't go looking for problems, just sit back and enjoy what you have. The Ten serves as a kind of final test in the lessons learned through the other Cups cards. If you have skipped a lesson, you will have to learn it and try again. If you have paid attention, there is nothing to fear and nothing that can take that rainbow out of the sky.@@br@@ Speaking of which, the rainbow is a very spiritual symbol in many religions. In Christian faiths it is a sign of God's protection over mankind, and it shows that the relationship pictured here on this card is dinively blessed, just as the union on the Lovers card was. Many old cultures, particularly the Norse, saw the rainbow as a bridge that joined the Earth with the realm of the gods. In the Ten of Cups, the rainbow of golden Cups serves a similar purpose. It reminds us that the greatest power in the world is that of love, and through love we can get a glimpse of Heaven. @@br@@ "},
{"image_path":"Cups11.jpg","description":"Why is it that young people have such vivid emotions and wild imaginations? Perhaps it is because, like the Page of Cups, they have never been taught to suppress their innate emotional and intuitive power. The Page of Cups is a person whose imagination is totally free, free to dream wonderful dreams and to create his life exactly as he chooses. But although his head is in the clouds, his feet rarely leave the ground. When his energy enters your life it manifests in one of three ways: as a person around you, as an event that you will experience, or as a part of yourself that you must bring into full manifestation.@@br@@ As an event, the Page of Cups refers almost exclusively to children, since he is so childlike himself. (Note that childlike does not mean the same thing as childish!) Pregnancies and the birth of children are often predicted by the Page of Cups, especially if the Page of Wands is nearby. He can also be a sign of a relationship or a friendship starting, a new level of happiness and pleasure in an existing relationship, or any event relating to emotional beginnings. Such beginnings can appear \out of the blue\ or they can come about through your own initiative, though they're often much more appreciated and exciting when they're unexpected!@@br@@ People represented by the Page of Cups are true romantics at heart. A Page of Cups person will be gentle and compassionate, often highly imaginative and artistic. He values tranquility and peace, and as such is often out of place in the modern world because he cannot always cope with conflict. He seems dreamy and detached a lot of the time, though beneath his quiet calmness lies a bravery and studiousness that could rival a Knight's. His ideas may seem elusive and impossible to realize but, more often than not, their base is solid. Though he can be moody and impractical because he is so rooted in the spiritual and the emotional, the Page of Cups is always ready to serve.@@br@@ The Page of Cups often shows a side of yourself that you need to manifest. This is increasingly common as humanity becomings more and more detached from its imaginative side in a world of technology and practicality. The Page's appearance tells you to never stop listening to your intuition and believing in your dreams. If you cease to dream, he tells us, then your dreams shall never come true because they do not exist anymore. In your darkest moments, dreams can often provide a ray of hope through with the Page of Cups can manifest. Dare to dream and all things become possible. @@br@@ "},
{"image_path":"Cups12.jpg","description":"Unlike two of the other Knighs, those of Wands and Swords, the Knight of Cups is not dashing across the land with the wind blowing through his hair. His horse moves forward, but slowly, giving an impression of calmness and peace. Indeed, the Knight of Cups is the most feminine of his group of four, though that does not mean by any definition that he is any less of a Knight. He is in touch with his intuition and emotions, and he uses them for his own good during his quests of romance and seduction. He can manifest as an event, a person in your life, or as a part of yourself.@@br@@ The posture of the Knight of Cups implies that of a messenger, so it comes as little surprise that he often manifests as a bearer of news. He represents invitations, messages of love and proposals of marriage. In addition to the physical sources of information, the Knight of Cups can also represent wisdom that comes from your dreams to help you surmount obstacles in your life at the moment. Sometimes this card can represent the start of a relationship, but in this case if often serves to warn one or both partners. It shows daydreaming and idealism, and it can highlight relationships in which one partner is placed on an unfair pedestal.@@br@@ Given that, it's easy to see that the person represented by the Knight of Cups will be a dreamer, one who is prone to wild ideas and flights of fancy. His wild imagination puts a bit of a spark in any relationship he's involved in, and he always seems to be in a relationship of some kind because he's a born romantic - and a hopeless flirt. Beneath his calm exterior he is a man of intense passion, though he generally diverts this passion towards reaching his goals and making his dreams come true. His is an idealistic view of life that is scorned by the active and despised by the realist. Inversely, he has no tolerance for people who cannot believe in their dreams.@@br@@ When you are getting too wrapped up in your dreams, or when your idealism is starting to blind you, the Knight of Cups will appear as a warning. When you have no dreams and your view is too realistic, he will appear to show you what you are missing out on! As the Knight of the suit of Water, his view of life is fairly moderate in the majority of cases. Follow your dreams, but do not let them become an obsession. Develop your imagination, and let it guide you, but never let it rule you or lead you to ruin. Show love but do not go overboard and become committed to something you cannot handle. Make sure you are in control of your life, and your dreams. @@br@@ "},
{"image_path":"Cups13.jpg","description":"No intuition is more powerful than that of the Queen of Cups. She is the pure force of Water, and her connection with the subconscious is rivalled only by the High Priestess. She is often like a mirror, reflecting the hidden depths of others back to them, so they can see their own mysteries for themselves. However, her cup is closed, and her own secrets remain invisible to all, even to herself sometimes. Such is the paradox and fluidity of the Water element. Hardly ever manifesting as an event, the Queen of Cups is almost always found either in people near you, or in yourself.@@br@@ A Queen of Cups in the real world feels right at home in the realms of the subconscious. If she is not psychic, she will posess extraordinary insight into the behaviour and motivations of others. As such, she is often a gifted counsellor and healer, ready to provide a shoulder to cry on and a hand to hold whenever they are needed. She is beautiful by almost all standards, because her beauty is the purity of her spirit, and such magnificence has a universally recognizable allure. Even when not physically attractive, she still attracts others to her. A Queen of Cups will also be a dreamer, with wondrous fantasies and a vivid imagination.@@br@@ It is from this that the Queen's more negative qualities arise. She often loses herself in her fantasies and daydreams, and though completely confident in her instincts, more often than not she is totally unable to apply these instincts to anything in the real world. At music, poetry, mothering and artistry, no one can compete with her - in everything else she is mediocre, at best. Spending as long as she does in the spiritual world tends to make her quite uncomfortable when she has to leave it. She places much importance on relationships because she sees herself as unable to stand alone.@@br@@ A Queen of Cups lies within each of us, and in some it is closer to the surface than in others. When she appears in reference to an aspect of your own personality, the Queen of Cups should be taken as a suggestion to think carefully about how you use the vast stores of spiritual wisdom you have access to all the time. She can be a sign that you should use you intuition to guide you - or she can be a warning that you are thinking too much with your heart and not with your head. This can cause your dreams to grow out of control... and out of reach. Like all of the Cups court cards, the Queen encourages a moderate approach to intuition and wisdom. The heart may see farther, but sometimes you will have to look at things with your eyes. @@br@@ "},
{"image_path":"Cups14.jpg","description":"The King of Cups is a strangely ambivalent figure. Such a powerful male form seems almost out of place amidst the element of Water, just as the Queen of Wands is somewhat uncomfortable in the realm of Fire. This is why the King of Cups is often seen as a card of contradictions. He represents someone who is calm on the surface, yet passionate and volatile underneath. He shows a situation that is not entirely what is appears to be at first glance. Under his facetious exterior the King of Cups hides ulterior motives. He can be found in our lives as another person or as a facet of our own personality.@@br@@ Usually a man of art or religion, the King of Cups appears as a wise advisor and a noble healer. He listens to the suggestions of others, even when they are in conflict with his own carefully formed opinions. He never judges, never blames others for their faults, and is always a sympathetic supporter. In return, others always gather around to hear what he has to say because his wisdom speaks directly to the heart. He is a natural diplomat, a romantic to the core and a stimulating partner, whether in conversation, friendship or a sexual relationship. He rarely lacks confidence, and in those rare cases when he does, nobody realizes it.@@br@@ In fact, the King of Cups is almost always hiding something. He enjoys the quiet power he holds over others, and his personal agenda is as well-crafted as his speeches. He is a seducer who thrives on the company of women, and he is often selfish and unfaithful. Though he does have an air of innocence to him, his character is often not deep enough to reach it. All of this comes about as a direct result of the battle between his fiery soul and his watery heart. The two opposing influences pull him in totally different directions, and often he does not know which to follow. As you might expect of such a combination, he is insecure and indecisive, often letting others act for him. @@br@@ The appearance of the King is often a sign that you should employ peace and tolerance to solve your problems. Use diplomacy rather than force, and accept different points of view. Do not blame others for their failures, but help them to see how they can succeed again. When the King of Cups represents a part of yourself, you must make sure the King of Cups is not manifesting his energy in a negative form. The moderation theme of the Cups suit is critical. If you strive too far into the fiery side of the King you will be burned by his inner flames, but if you slip into the deep water of his emotions you could be overwhelmed and drowned. Stay in the middle and you'll be safe. @@br@@ "},
{"image_path":"Pents01.jpg","description":"The Ace of Pentacles is the foundation for all kinds of projects in the real world; this foundaton is as valuable as gold, and as solid as concrete. It is the cornerstone of a building that might stand for decades, or crumble to dust after a few years - this is determined by how the rest of the structure is put together. The Ace of Pentacles is not the promise of long-lasting financial and material security that some might expect, but it is the sign that such things are within your reach. It gives you the resources to go in search of higher goals.@@br@@ The appearance of this card is usually the sign of a turn for the better in terms of fortune and wealth, and sometimes it can even indicate gifts of money, or inheritance from unexpected sources (hence the coin appearing from \thin air\). This gift does not have to be money of course; any kind of gift that has value to both the giver and the receiver can be indicated by the Ace of Pentacles. In particular, the card often refers to wedding rings and proposals of marriage, which may seem out of place in the Pentacles suit until you realize that such proposals are the solid foundation upon which the castles of love must be built.@@br@@ The Ace also represents the fertile soil in which ideas can be planted to grow and mature. This will be a slow growth, as the Pentacles never move at a fast pace, but the success of the harvest is practically assured. The only caveat is that the Pentacles suit demands a realistic outlook. If you want to succeed, start now - it is not the time to dream and fantasize when there is work to be done! Forget flourish and dramatics, because hard work is the only thing that is going to produce results when the Ace of Pentacles is afoot. Keep your feet firmly planted in the Earth and let your common sense (and your intuition) guide you to success.@@br@@ More often than not, the realms of material and spiritual wealth are mutually exclusive, and in some cases they are in fact detrimental to one another. But on the Ace of Pentacles all types of wealth are portrayed, and though the material world is certainly in full view, most cards feature a gateway or a passage into the more spiritual realm far in the background. The Rider-Waite is typical of this; through the gap in the hedges we can see the cold white mountains of abstract and spiritual thought. You can achieve spiritual peace through material means, if you knows the path. @@br@@ "},
{"image_path":"Pents02.jpg","description":"The duality of the number Two is particularly strong in the Two of Pentacles because it implies both balance and change, a combination of the inactive and the active that at first seems rather absurd. After all, if something is constantly changing, how can it be kept in balance? Seeing that balance is also a dynamic quality is the key to understanding the energy of the Two of Pentacles. It's like a juggler who keeps his balls in constant motion but always under his control.@@br@@ The Two of Pentacles is often a sign that a change in your life in general, and your financial situation in particular, is almost certain. This card embodies the principle of \life at the edge of chaos\ - too much change and life falls apart, too little change and it stagnates. Constant change and self-improvement is the only way to develop the body and the mind, and the Two of Pentacles is certainly an advocate of this philosophy. If you have been feeling bored lately, have some fun for a change! But if you are not working at all because you're playing all the time, cut back a little. The principle of balance is the one that ultimately rules here.@@br@@ In terms of the material world alone, the Two of Pentacles is often a sign that you have several projects underway all at once. These projects can be work related, personal hobbies, or other matters. This card can even show the dynamic balance between family and career. It is usually a sign that you have everything under control, for the moment. But even a master juggler cannot juggle forever, and this card is often a reminder that you will have to cut back sooner or later. This could mean neglecting one project in order to finish another. Dropping one project is preferable to dropping them all. @@br@@ Going hand in hand with this idea is the warning that trying to take on any more projects at this time would probably be a bad idea. When a juggler has perfectly balanced two balls, and a third ball is added, he may continue to juggle them dextrously - or they may all fall to the ground. In times like this, the Two of Pentacles tells you to be flexible. If an opportunity comes along that you can't afford to miss, but you already have a lot of projects to watch already, one of those may have to be sacrificed so you can take on the new opportunity. Above all, balance must be maintained in the face of sweeping changes. @@br@@ "},
{"image_path":"Pents03.jpg","description":"The Three of Pentacles embodies the principle that hard work and service are rewards unto themselves. Everyone seeks a job that they can enjoy and do well at, and this card shows such careers that are both emotionally and financially fulfilling. It seems that this kind of career is less and less available these days, but the Three of Pentacles shows that some of us can still find such work. These jobs are those which inspire you to work hard, to do your best and to cooperate with others towards the accomplishment of a common goal. They are fulfilling on all levels.@@br@@ This card often shows the master at work, the professional who has learned all aspects of his career and is now putting all that knowledge to use in the real world. If you want to be like this in your job, there are many things that you must do. You have to be responsible and fair in your dealings with others. You must stick to schedules, follow procedures, and do everything by the book. All of this may sound boring and counterproductive to expression of the self, but this is a Pentacle card, and this is the suit of regulations and conservativism. The Pentacles ideal is security given by convention.@@br@@ But within that convention you are totally free to express yourself, and to find ways to further develop your skills and yourself. If you have found success recently - the Three of Pentacles is a sign of such early success - then build upon it and make your future all the brighter. This card shows that, with determination and hard work, anything is possible. It's all a matter of devoting energy to a cause and seeing opportunities where no one else can. Look at every opportunity as a sculptor looks at a block of stone, or as a painter views a bare white canvas. See the potential underneath the plain and dull exterior.@@br@@ The artist is perhaps the one who can have ultimate freedom of expression through his work, because each masterpiece is really a piece of the master who created it. The Three of Pentacles is a sign that anyone, not just the sculptors and painters, can express themselves through their career, and it is an indication that you should certainly try. This does not mean that you can neglect the more serious aspects of your job in order to amuse yourself, howeer. The balance of work and pleasre found on the Two can be integrated, but that balance cannot be lost or thrown away. To do so is to defeat the purpose of this card. @@br@@ "},
{"image_path":"Pents04.jpg","description":"It is the nature of the Pentacles suit - and indeed, the nature of the human being - to favor tradition and be apprehensive of change. After all, change can upset the security and balance that we are taught to achieve, and once we have found success, shouldn't we try to keep it? Such a philosophy has led to many people staying successful, but it has also led to others losing everything they hoped to preserve. To try and fight change is a task which ultimately proves futile. The fear of loss may certainly prevent loss, but it also prevents further gain.@@br@@ The Four of Pentacles can show times of material security and happiness, and it often marks a time of financial gain, either earned through work or simply acquired from another source, such as inheritance. It is a card of earthly power, but with no accompanying emotional or spiritual gain. This is where its meaning starts to take a more negative turn. Without the wisdom to help you manage your material assets, you will either squander them or start to hoard them. Both will lead to frustration and disappointment. Power without the knowledge to use that power frequently harms the user.@@br@@ This is the card of the miser, and it shows us all the effects of greed and selfishness. The miser refuses to help others who are in need, because there is a risk that he would lose some of his hard-earned money. Thus he loses a lot of the people whom he considered friends. As a miser you stop having fun because you are constantly preoccupied with how much \fun\ will cost. Your foundations may be stable, but you can never be comfortable if your home is a fortress and you spend every waking moment trying to defend it. And sooner or later, despite your efforts, change will strike and you will be humbled. @@br@@ This card often embodies holding on, to money, to posessions or even to other people. In the majority of cases, one thing that the Four of Pentacles tells us is that we have to let go. By letting go of greed and selfishness you may lose a bit of your money, but the gain in terms of happiness will outweigh any material loss. Sometimes you may find that you are clinging to the past just as the man on this card clings to his coins, and if so, the appearance of the Four of Pentacles should be taken as a sign to put your past behind you. Even if you think the past was better than the present, you must not cling to it or use it as a security blanket. @@br@@ "},
{"image_path":"Pents05.jpg","description":"In a world that equates success with financial security, the loss shown on the Five of Pentacles can be a humbling blow to one's self-esteem. This can be brought about in many ways, but even though an exterior event may seem to be the cause, this card often shows a loss that you bring upon yourself. Even though the Pentacles are a material suit, and Fives usually deal with real-world problems, the theme of poverty is not the true destitution shown on the Five of Pentacles. There is a spiritual loss that often precedes or accompanies loss of material wealth.@@br@@ But since outer problems must often be resolved before inner conflict can be attended to, the outer meaning of the Five of Pentacles shall be explained first. This card shows the many faces of material misfortune and lack: loss of funds, general poverty, illness, unemployment, solitude. The card also tells you that many of these are caused by your emotions. Greed will lead to loss, anxiety will lead to error, possessiveness will lead to solitude. By focusing on the material, you lose sight of the spiritual development the Ace promised. You may be rich for a while, but all will be lost if you learn nothing.@@br@@ This leads up to the more spiritual meaning of the Five of Pentacles. This card represents the dark night of the soul, when you must stumble around in the darkness because you can no longer see the light shining within you. Often, during times like this, salvation is not far away, but because you are so preoccupied with your material problems you cannot see it. The two people on the Rider-Waite card walk by a brightly lit church, unable to acknowledge how close a solution to their destitution is. The church is an apt symbol because it provides spiritual comfort while helping those who cannot help themselves.@@br@@ When the Five of Pentacles appears it is almost always a warning that you are likely to experience some kind of loss, material or otherwise. If this loss has not yet happened you can prevent it or lessen the blow. Worrying about problems like this will do nothing but make them even worse, so stop worrying and start doing something! If you are in a situation where you have lost a great deal, know that you have the ability to get it back. There is always a solution, always a way out, always a church window just around the corner. So either open your eyes and go to it, or close your eyes and let the inner light guide you. @@br@@ "},
{"image_path":"Pents06.jpg","description":"The epiphany of Ebeneezer Scrooge, maybe the most profound and sudden change of heart in literature, carries a feeling of generosity very similar to that of the Six of Pentacles. The Six is the dawning of the light after the dark night of the Five, and the realization that material wealth and spiritual wealth are so different after all. The lesson of the Ace has been learned. Just like the scales often pictured on this card, generosity has two sides. This card shows when you are the person expressing generosity, or when you are the recipient of someone else's good favor.@@br@@ The Six of Pentacles often represents the first of these two situations, when it is your generosity that is being (or should be) expressed. Now that you have lived through the darkness long enough to see the inner light, it is time to help others who are not so fortunate. The generosity of the Six does not limit itself to money and material things, though the focus is on those because it is a Pentacle card. Giving of your time or your wisdom is often just as spiritually fulfilling as giving away money or gifts, and the intangible gift of your presence is received just as well, if not better.@@br@@ There are limits on helping, however. It is pointless to give so much that you ruin yourself, and it is equally pointless to give a person so much that they become totally dependent on you. That is the purpose of the scales, which offer the qualities of discrimination and fair judgement as they relate to generosity. To paraphrase Marx, give according to your abilities, and according to the needs of others. And if too many people start asking for your help it is not forbidden to draw the line! Do not make the mistake of half-heartedly helping everyone when you can do a better job helping a few. @@br@@Sometimes you must call on the kindness of others to help you through dark times, especially those periods of spiritual darkness depicted on the Five. The appearance of the Six of Pentacles can thus indicate that someone in your life is willing to help you, either by giving you money or by offering you advice that will set you on the right track. When it seems that the Six of Pentacles is telling you that you have to be generous, think about who in your life needs help and how they need it. The law of cause and effect is in force here - expect rewards of your generosity. A new friend could easily be made through a good deed and a kind word. @@br@@ "},
{"image_path":"Pents07.jpg","description":"The Seven of Pentacles shows those times when a choice must be made between keeping what you have and trying to get more. This is probably the most overtly dualistic of the Pentacles cards and, as befits the nature of the suit, both choices can seem lucrative at different times and in different circumstances. On one hand, we have the conservative viewpoint of not taking risks and keeping what you have. There is also the option of going out and getting more wealth, but at the risk of losing it all. The decision is so difficult because neither option is largely preferable to the other, and both are supported by the Pentacles nature.@@br@@ After completing a project, and after receiving rewards for your hard work, you often get a feeling of dissatisfaction. This can come about by a number of reasons. If you feel that you haven't done your best, naturally you'll want to try again and do things better. If what you've accomplished doesn't seem as wonderful as you expected it might, you'll have to re-evaluate all your plans and try something new. Or perhaps you just feel some kind of emptiness inside you. You've won a great victory; that's great, but what do you do now? Obviously you cannot rest on your laurels - change is necessary. @@br@@ But the Pentacles suit tells us that with change comes risk. Why jeopardize the success you have, incomplete as it may be, in an attempt to gain even more? Shouldn't you be happy with what you have? In material matters at least, staying where you are is often more prudent than risking everything for the sake of a small gain. This is the great dilemma you have to face on the Seven of Pentacles. So when this card appears, take it as a sign to rest for a while, look back on all you've accomplished, and then decide whether you're going to leave or stay.@@br@@ God rested on the seventh day to assess what He had done, so after any long period of hard work, even if you've already decided that you're not going to change anything, take a few moments to look back and reflect. You'll likely find you're heading in the right direction anyway, in which case you should proceed with renewed vigor and tenacity. But if it looks like going further might mean risking all you've won, there is much to be said for staying where you are. There is no dishonor in keeping what you have; if you wish you can always change your mind later. @@br@@ "},
{"image_path":"Pents08.jpg","description":"The Eight of Pentacles is the first card of its suit to touch explicity on the spiritual realm, though it does so briefly and in certain circumstances only. Most of the time it refers to a time of hard work and dedication on the material realm, in the hopes of improving your work and yourself at the same time. Unlike the Three, which shows a rewarding and expressive career, the work shown on the Eight often goes without reward until the very end. But once that end is finally reached, the rewards are often unimaginable; they transcend the material realm.@@br@@ In material affairs, this card shows the kind of dedication that is often necessary to achieve success. This is a wide umbrella covering many concepts such as attention to detail, persistence, concentration, and working for the sake of working. The Eight of Pentacles also implies a sense of material and financial security if we remain committed to the task. This committment does not have to remain limited to the material world, however. The Eight can be a sign of commitment and dedication to a relationship, or genuine interest in learning new skills. It is at this point that the spiritual meaning of the Eight becomes apparent.@@br@@ Often the man on the Eight of Pentacles is pictured as an apprentice learning a new skill. Like the Hermit, he seeks knowledge, and sometimes this wisdom will be of the spiritual sort. The apprentice's goal is practical experience rather than theory, however, because theory can only get you so far in the real world. Beyond that, you have to work through your problems with earned practical knowledge. This is the card of applied skill, intelligence devoted to a task. The Eight of Pentacles also governs learning through doing, and reflects the Confucian proverb:@@br@@@@br@@ When the Eight of Pentacles appears in reference to a project or a task you have been working on, redouble your efforts and your concentration, because rewards are near. What you are undertaking will be difficult, but it will give you a lot of valuable work experience and knowledge. Watch for someone more experienced that you who may be willing to gave you assistance; every apprentice needs a master to guide them towards greatness. Never take your eyes off the goal. If a job is once begun, never leave until it's done. Be the labor great or small, do it well - or not at all. @@br@@ "},
{"image_path":"Pents09.jpg","description":"Nine is a number of perfection and completion; the Nine of Pentacles shows both of these, in both the material and spiritual realms. Though primarily a materialistic card, as all the Pentacles are, it does bear a spiritual side as well. A lifetime of work and refinement brings not only material rewards, but wisdom and satisfaction as well. Abundance in material wealth leads to abundance in emotion, and that leads eventually to abundance in spirit. This relationship is reversible too, for through spiritual development we gain the means to become even richer.@@br@@ The main focus of the Nine of Pentacles, again, is on the material plane. It shows a solid financial base, assured security and comfort. This is the natural end of the choice made on the Seven and the hard work of the Eight. Sometimes it will come through windfall or inheritance but in the majority of cases it must be earned and fought for. This provides the responsibility necessary to manage your new wealth, and the experience to decide what to do with it now. A certain degree of self-discipline is implied by the Nine, and with this self-discipline comes the assurance that your wealth will not be wasted or squandered.@@br@@ You have a right to be proud of all you've accomplished, and others certainly should recognize your success. But if they do not, that is all right. The only judge of your success is you, and if you are pleased with yourself, that is all that matters. This is the lesson of the Nine of Pentacles: material success will help you build upon your own self-worth, and even if you lose all that physical wealth, your opinion of yourself can never be changed once it is established. It certainly can never be taken away from you. Enjoyment of your fortune does not depend on others, it depends on you!@@br@@ The Nine of Pentacles is really a balance between material accomplishment and spiritual wisdom; a combination of having wealth and taking pleasure from it. This balance implies that you cannot concentrate on having wealth - you must learn from it and use it to develop your self-worth. Such development leads inevitably to future rewards such as raises and promotions, which will raise your self-esteem again. This card often shows the necessity to take a good look at yourself and see just how wealthy you really are, in terms of both the material and spiritual treasures in your possession. Wishes for success may already have been granted. @@br@@ "},
{"image_path":"Pents10.jpg","description":"One of the great problems with having wealth is what exactly to do with it, and this is the central concept of the Ten of Pentacles. All of the positive traits of the Pentacles suit are embodied here; security, happiness, and the spiritual wisdom that comes with experience in the real world. Like the rest of the Tens, the Ten of Pentacles reminds us that we have learned important lessons through the other suit cards, and now we are challenged to apply them to the problem at hand. So now that you have all the wealth you need and all the happiness you want... what do you do?@@br@@ Trying to amass more wealth, one of the choices shown on the Seven, is a bad idea at this point. Obviously you cannot simply hold onto it, for the lesson on the Four was that such attempts at security always fail. Trying to hold onto wealth in case you need it later is often like trying to capture love in a bottle. By trying to hold onto these things you often end up crushing them in your fingers, rather than preserving them for the future. So holding on tightly is not an option. The Six of Pentacles, however, showed that you cannot simply give it all away, because you must benefit from wealth too.@@br@@ The solution given by the Ten of Pentacles is to pass on your wealth - both spiritual and material - to the next generation, so they might gain as much success as you have. Even if your physical riches are limited, the advice that can be given by a father to his son, or a grandparent to grandchildren, is no less valuable. This is the purpose of inheritance and legacy; to pass on something to your successors so they will remember you. This can be in the form of money, and it often is, though the best form of inheritance is often the intangible. A monument or a spoken word has much more effect on the world than a pile of cash.@@br@@ The Ten of Pentacles urges you to consider the many uses of wealth, the most important of which is assuring the future success and well-being of those we care for. The truly rich man is he who is wealthy in both body and spirit, and the gifts offered in the Ten of Pentacles are one of the best ways to attain this level of wealth. During your material endeavors, never forget your goal of spiritual richness. If you wish to be remembered, pass on your wisdom and experience to those who need it.

{"image_path":"Pents11.jpg","description":"The Page of Pentacles is the most responsible of the Pages, a trait which is shared by all the Pentacles court cards because of their Earth nature. The fact that someone so young can be so down-to-earth and ready to accept great responsibility is a rare event, and a Page of Pentacles in your midst is a rare and welcome sight. Though he may only be concerned with the immediate benefits of wealth, the Page still manages it far better than the majority of adults do. He can appear, like the other Pages, in one of three ways. He can be an event, a person in your life, or a part of your own personality. @@br@@When representing an event, the Page of Pentacles almost always refers to a material or career matter. (The exception is when he appears with the Page of Cups or Wands which can indicate a pregnancy.) A new job, a promotion or just a new time in your current job can all be predicted by his appearance. In any case, good financial news is likely, and you should be alert for a messenger who will enter your life to bring you this news. Even if the news doesn't seem to be good at first glance, there is always potential in the messages the Page of Pentacles brings. Your task in such situation is to examine the message and figure out what the real opportnity is.@@br@@ As a person, a Page of Pentacles is generally young of body but old of mind. He is a diligent worker and an efficient manager, who uses common sense more than intuition and does things by the book rather than taking risks. Despite this, however, he is always open to new ideas and isn't as rigidly dogmatic as the rest of the Pentacles court cards. He sees the opportunities that are inherent in every situation and he finds the best ways to exploit them based on the resources at his disposal. The Page of Pentacles takes great pleasure in the world, and he will try to preserve its beauty just as he will preserve the old ways of thinking and doing things.@@br@@ The Page of Pentacles within each of us is a good energy to call upon when we must manage a team or handle a big responsibility. Gather your resources and use them wisely, because only through such wisdom can success be achieved. When this energy is strong within you, you will often develop a passion for learning and absorbing new ideas. These new ideas don't need to be limited to career and finances, though you'll find that a lot of your ideas can and will be applied to business. Look for opportunities to develop and express your new ideas and find success. Apply knowledge with enthusiasm, think practically in all situations, and you cannot fail. @@br@@ "},
{"image_path":"Pents12.jpg","description":"Though his visions may not be earth-shattering, and his methods are certainly not original, the Knight of Pentacles sees that everything he undertakes will meet with nothing but success. He is the least kinetic of the four Knights, probably the least ambitious, though he carries the burden of responsibility that the other Knights often throw away in their haste to find glory and excitement. His energy manifests in three ways: as an event that you will experience, a person whom you will meet, or a part of yourself that needs to be developed and expressed.@@br@@ As an event, the Knight of Pentacles often shows a time when you will have to assume responsibility and take charge of a situation. You could be assigned a project or given a task to do, and you will have to devote some of your time to see that project end successfully. Perhaps the responsibility will not be due to a new project, but an old failure that you have to account for. In either case, stand tall and accept responsibility without any complaints or manipulations. The Knight of Pentacles has the strongest body of all the Knights, as well as the strongest character. In situations like the ones he represents, the latter is often more useful.@@br@@ Where another man will charge in head-first, and end up doing little more than hurting himself, the person represented by the Knight of Pentacles will assess the situation. And then he will strike with the force of a hurricane, decisively and implacably. He is a dedicated worker and a loyal servant; when he says something will get done, it will. His persistence is virtually inexhaustible and he'll keep at a task until it's complete. His word is as strong as his hand, and he takes all of his promises seriously. The Knight of Pentacles likes doing things the old-fashioned way, and it could be said that his weakness is his lack of imagination. The old ways work fine for him, and he disklikes those who cannot keep their heads out of the clouds.@@br@@ There are many reasons to be like the Knight of Pentacles. In times when few people honor promises and value responsibilities, his energy is a welcome breath of duty and loyalty. When his energy is strong within you, never back down from responsibility and hold true to your word. Others will respect you if you give them reason to, and once they are your friends, never let them down and they will stay at your side through anything. Hard work produces the results you desire, if you are realistic in the pursuit of your goals. Leave nothing to chance, make plans and outline objectives. You have great potential for success if you stay firmly grounded. @@br@@ "},
{"image_path":"Pents13.jpg","description":"The Queen of Pentacles is a card in which the energy of a Major Arcanum is reproduced, but on a more accessible level. She is like a mirror of the Empress in that she is a Queen of fertility and harvest, and her talents extend to mothering and nurturing as well. The only thing she really lacks that the Empress possesses is the ability to create life, but the Queen of Pentacles makes up for that with her ability to sustain and care for all kinds of life. She is materially wealthy, but even that is superseded by the wealth she has build through kindness and generosity. She manifests in your life as either a person or a part of yourself.@@br@@ The person known as the Queen of Pentacles is often a mother, but sometimes she will express motherly dedication and love despite having no children of her own. Her watery quality gives her the intuitive and emotional skills needed of a good mother, while the Pentacles suit gives her a solid schooling in material matters and affairs. Her ambitions center on the family and her goals are a happy material and emotional life. These simple goals are often difficult to obtain, but she devotes herself to them. Though not necessarily rich in terms of money, she is always rich of heart, and she shares her wealth with all those in need.@@br@@ Her only real weakness is an obsession with the security and protection that the Pentacles suit embodies, and this should come as little surprise because the Empress has trouble in this area as well. In modern times her role has degraded considerably because the terms \homemaker\ and \housewife\, which generally apply to the Queen of Pentacles and those like her, are derogatory and devalued. Although she sees no problem with expressing love with the creation of a happy home, many people seem to have a problem with that, and think she should \get a real job\. A true Queen of Pentacles will tolerate such people, who obviously have no idea how \real\ her job can become.@@br@@ When the Queen of Pentacles inside of you starts manifesting, the signs are unmistakable. Generosity will become a priority, as will trustworthiness and reliability. You will gain insight into both matters of money and matters of the heart, and through these you can find a path to spiritual enlightenment. The Queen of Pentacles is, in many ways, a bridge between the worlds of the mundane and the spectacular. Step across that bridge once you are ready, and delight in the opulence and pure beauty. Then you can return to the material world to help others find their way. You may not be acknowledged, but you will never be unhappy either. @@br@@ "},
{"image_path":"Pents14.jpg","description":"The King of Pentacles is a lot like King Midas - everything he touches turns to gold. He is a pillar of financial stability, with wealth and experience to share with everybody. This is the logical conclusion of all the positive ideals of the Pentacles suit: through diligence, responsibility and attention to detail we can and will become like the King of Pentacles. He is always rich materially if not spiritually, and he encourages you to live your life like he would. When this card appears he can either represent a person in your life, or a part of yourself trying to be expressed.@@br@@ No one has a stronger character than the King of Pentacles. His word is as good as his gold, and certainly just as valuable. He's similar to the Knight in that whatever he says he will do, will get done. But where the Knight takes on responsibility for the sake of responsibility, the King is in it for profit. He's a businessman to the core, the master of the material world. This could be seen as a fault, and it can certainly become so if he lets it get too far out of hand, but this rarely happens. He has too much experience and intelligence to be swept away by the allure of money; he prefers the security and peace of mind that it brings him.@@br@@ A lot of people see the King of Pentacles as dull and unimaginative, but this is probably because he simply prefers old ways of thinking and acting. This is not to say that he refuses to learn new things; in fact, he likes learning and has a wide variety of skills to call upon. But the old methods usually work best for a King of Pentacles and so he sticks with them. He is relied upon because of his devotion to duty and his trustworthiness. It's rare to see a King of Pentacles get angry, because they have a steady temperament and a very long fuse. But he is unforgiving to those who violate his trust, and for those people he has absolutely no mercy.@@br@@ Whenever you need the skills to manage your material affairs competently and efficiently, you can call upon the King of Pentacles. Take up all the vast challenges of the material world, and know that you can conquer them all if you work hard. Give generously of your time and resources, because by giving you often receive more, and making more money is something that all Kings of Pentacles love to do! When he appears, know that you have reached the height of achievement and you don't need to take any more risks. Simply watch for the right time to draw money and wealth to yourself. Let the King inspire you to success so you can inspire others in turn. @@br@@ "},
{"image_path":"RWS_Tarot_01_Magician.jpg","description":"The Magician's number is One, the number of creation and individuality; his power is transformation through the use of his will. In his manipulation of the basic elements into all the substances and materials of life, he shows us that from a foundation of the mundane can emerge all that is to come. He can take the Nothing from which the Fool emerged and shape it into Something, making one out of zero. Clearly this is power of a divine sort, and it is true that the Magician is a conduit for a higher power, which commands all of the material world. Since all that we can see in the physical world is the conduit himself, the acts he performs often seem like magic.@@br@@ The Magician may seem like a strange title for someone who holds real power, because the word \magician\ tends to conjure up pictures of illusionists and escape artists, whose power involves sleight of hand and misdirection. The Magician, however, is similar to the stage illusionist in many ways. He is confident in his skills and his ability to produce the effects that he wants. His real power comes from sources outside of him, and he is powerless without these sources, just as an illusionist depends on people \behind the scenes\. Both magician and Magician, however, are as important to their powers are the powers are to them. Without a conduit, power itself is impotent and useless. @@br@@ With his powers the Magician holds influence over all - theory and practice, logic and emotion, thought and action. Almost every modern depiction of the Magician includes one or more symbols of infinity to denote his limitless power; the snake eating its tail and the lemniscate (horizontal figure-eight) being chief among these. This limitless power comes from sources outside his body yet under his control. And as long as the Magician remembers that this power is his to command, even if he loses all of his worldly power and skill he can never truly be called powerless. For his Will is a power that, while it can be subdued, it can never be destroyed.@@br@@ Another nearly universal association with the Magician is the red-and-white color scheme. This theme recurs throughout the Tarot and it is very symbolic that it starts with this card and not the Fool. For while the Fool was the potential for positive and negative, the Magician is the union of positive and negative. He creates and he preserves; he destroys and he redeems. His true power is that he not only knows what he must do, but he knows how he must do it, and why he must do it. Then he does it. The Magician reminds us that a wish alone will change nothing, but a decision can change everything. A desire to create is nothing without an ability to create, and vice-versa. @@br@@ When the Magician appears he shows that you are ready to become a conduit for power, like he is. The forces of creation and destruction have always been at your command but now you have the wisdom and confidence needed to use them constructively. Now is the time to act, if you know what is it you want to accomplish and why. Since the powers of transformation are at your command, change your desires into objectives, your thoughts into actions, your goals into achievements. If you have recently met with failure, now you can change that failure into success as easily as the Magician changes fire into water. The only limits you have are those you impose on yourself.@@br@@ The outward manifestations of such power are as numerous as they are varied, but the most common outer effect of the Magician's influence is unswaying and total confidence. The realization that the world is under your control is what inspires this kind of confidence, and with good reason. So go out into the world, set your mind to whatever goal you are interested in, and then just stand back and watch as everything falls into place under your command. Ultimately, the message of the Magician is a simple one despite his limitless and infinitely complex power. Your life is under your control. Your life is what you want it to be. Your life is what you make it. @@br@@ "},
{"image_path":"RWS_Tarot_03_Empress.jpg","description":"The Empress represents a departure from the dualistic philosophy of the first three Major Arcana, as well as from the strongly spiritual teachings of those three cards. Rather than simple dichotomies of positive and negative, the Tarot now starts dealing with the unfication of spirit, mind and body. The Empress is the latter leg of this triad, representing the physical body and the material world. From her comes all the pleasure of the senses and the abundance of life in all its forms. She is also the mother archetype, and through her we get a first glimpse of the power of love in the Tarot.@@br@@ The world of the Empress is an ideal and perfectly beautiful place, totally natural, untouched by artificial colors, lights or sounds. This is a place of bounty and fertility, a living representation of the process of creation and birth that the Empress herself symbolizes. She doesn't just live in this place, she is this place, just as much as the Priestess is the balance that keeps apart positive and negative. The Empress is no less beautiful than the flowers that throw their scent across her fields, no less fertile than the soil that lies underneath her throne. If anything represents the idea of Mother Earth in the Tarot, then it is the Empress.@@br@@ Her primary power, like the two Arcana before her, is the power of creation. But her creation is not based on creating the world she wishes to live in, or the person she wants to be, because she has that world and is that person. She creates life in all its myriad forms. The Empress is the archetype of the mother, the ultimate creator and giver of life; thus her associations can be extended beyond creativity into fertility, pregnancy and the daunting task of motherhood, which she always faces with a smile and a happy heart. She takes pleasure in all things, particularly her own creations - and everything in nature is her own creation.@@br@@ Tying into the theme of motherhood is the notion of unconditional love, which the Empress also represents. She makes no demands, sets no conditions, just loves everything equally and with all the power she can. From this, it can be said, derives her only real weakness, and it is something that all mothers deal with at some point. She is often over-protective of her creations, and wishes no harm to come to them at all. That would disrupt the eternal bliss and happiness of her realm. But as it is, the realm of the Empress is both the picture of beauty and of stagnation. So while the Empress' love can make you feel as secure as if we are in your mother's arms, it can also turn into a prison if experienced for too long.@@br@@ When the Empress appears in your life, you should make special effort to open up to her perfect and unconditional love. In that way you can become more like her: gentle and affectionate, gracious and elegant. Such qualities are often neglected, but they are also useful in a world of harshness and apathy. So instead of plodding through life, take some time to celebrate it! The Empress can often herald the conception or the birth of a child, and in that circumstance there is even greater reason to celebrate. Inspire others to do the same; the Empress is a leader, and the power she holds over other people is firm, but loving. Know this and lead as she would.@@br@@ Know also that the perfectly abundant world of the Empress is always free for you to enjoy. Even if you know that you have to go back to the \real world\ eventually, a vacation from the hectic and artificial life that most people live these days will certainly be welcome. Spend some time outdoors, in the fresh air, enjoying every aspect of creation. And then, when you go back to where you were, the Empress' creative power and beauty will remain to inspire you and give you power. Strengthen your innate connection with the Earth's creativity and you will, by association, strengthen your own creative power. Cultivate your creativity and plants the seeds of a bountiful harvest. @@br@@ "},
{"image_path":"RWS_Tarot_04_Emperor.jpg","description":"The second leg of the Body-Mind-Spirit triad is the Emperor, representing the power of the mind to shape the world. Such action does not take place at the command of the will, but through the command of the spoken or written word. The Emperor is the representation - and the ruler - of the structured and regulated world. This is an ideal world like the Empress', though one that is not always as beautiful or lavish. But just because it is more harsh does not mean it is any less necessary to enlightenment; on the contrary, it is completely necessary to balance Mind and Body, male and female.@@br@@ The Emperor is the opposite of the Empress in many ways. She is the Mother, he is the archetypal Father, wise in the ways of the world and knowledgeable of how to live as part of a structure along with everyone else. The Emperor does have a strong and powerful heart, as every father should, but he shows this side of himself through the imposition of strict guidelines and rules, as most fathers do. If anything he is even more protective than the Empress, because he has created order from chaos and wishes nothing to disturb that order. Underneath his royal robes hides the suit of armor which he proudly wears when defending those under his protection.@@br@@ The Emperor teaches us many things, the first of which being that every rule has an application and a reason for being. If we can understand this, then his world may not seem so restrictive after all. In fact, all restriction is ultimately for your own good, because without the law and order that this card so powerfully symbolizes, the world would fall into anarchy. Government and law both draw their power from him, but unlike the governmental figures that we hear so much about in modern times, the Emperor cannot be corrupted by power. He rules like King Arthur, who brought together the warring powers of England and knit them into the greatest empire the world has ever known. @@br@@He is truly the master of his realm, and he rules with a firm hand, but a just one. He will listen to the counsel of others, though the final decision is always his. War is one of his many tools and he will not hesitate to use violence to protect those he cares about. The privileged few who are subject to his protection always repay him with the loyalty and respect he deserves. But the Emperor's power does not only extend to the controlling of nations. He is also the father, the male role model who offers advice, sets direction and brings security. He takes what he has learned, and passes it on to the next generation, so someday they can be as wise and powerful as he is.@@br@@ Any of the Major Arcana can represent people, but the Emperor is the kind of energy that often manifests in the form of a person. Obviously all kinds of leaders and fathers will harbor some of his influence, but he can also show someone who acts like a father by setting tone and imposing structure. He is a regulating force and thus associated with the government, bureaucracy and the legal system; his appearance often indicates an encouter with one or more of these systems. The Emperor can also personify the assumption of power and control, by you or someone close to you. If you are the one in power, take care that you always use it wisely.@@br@@ Above all else, the Emperor shows the benefits of structure and logic ruling over the emotions and lesser desires. Often, domination of the mind over the heart is not wanted, but in some cases is it necessary and even welcomed. When hard choices must be made it's important to maintain your concentration and focus, and this is something the energy of the Emperor allows you to do. When he shows a part of you, let that part of you manifest and take control. Enjoy the assertiveness and confidence it brings. Forge ahead and do what you know is best. If you can master yourself then you should have little problem mastering the world and all the things in it. @@br@@ "},
{"image_path":"RWS_Tarot_05_Hierophant.jpg","description":"Spirit is the final leg of the triad that has been previously seen in the Empress and Emperor; the archetype of the spiritual world is the Hierophant. This is the card of beliefs, both religious and otherwise, though it does tend to focus on the religious and spiritual aspects because the Hierophant himself is often depicted as a holy man. Indeed, in some decks this card is known as the Pope or High Priest. But in actuality, a Hierophant is a person who holds 'forbidden' or 'secret' knowledge. While this could easily apply to the clergy, it has far greater scope than this. In a way it could be said that (with apologies to Crowley) every man and every woman is a Hierophant. @@br@@ The Hierophant can even stand for groups of more than one person, and in the majority of cases he is better represented by an institution than by a single person. This is because his is the power of the group and the society, who change the world to fit their beliefs. The same theme of control and change that first appeared with the Magician continues here in its fifth iteration; now there is still a well-defined leader, but the people do not follow him because they are ordered to. They follow because they are part of the group. The main philosophies of the Hierophant are that there's no \I\ in \team\, and that the good of the many outweighs the good of the one.@@br@@ Such a philosophy may seem unnecessarily restrictive but, as the Emperor has taught us, restriction leads to order. The Hierophant is charged with the maintenance and propagation of tradition and conventional beliefs, and anyone who goes against these beliefs is shunned. Balance and conformity are the goals of the Hierophant, and neither positive nor negative is emphasized - only tradition matters. In extreme cases, this can indeed have very negative effects (as Galileo found out) but in most cases having some tradition to follow is beneficial. The traditions and ceremonies of the church, which are particularly strong in this card, are a prime example of this.@@br@@ On a more personal level, the Hierophant is also a teacher or a mentor. One major role of a spiritual leader is to initiate others into the community and teach them the ways of the group. Obviously one who holds the secrets and is entrusted with the traditions of the group is a prime candidate to teach them to others, and the Hierophant plays this role well. Though his approach to teaching is one that centers on conformity and shuns individual expression for the moment, this can be helpful. Only once the student has mastered the ways of the group can he or she properly decide whether to remain or leave. @@br@@When the Hierophant appears it will often be in the form of a teacher or a mentor, who instructs you in the ways of his particular belief in the hopes that you will join him. Such teachers do not have to be of a spiritual or mystical background; an employer training a new employee in the operation of a business is as much a Hierophant as any religious teacher. If your current situation seems to require more experience then you can call upon, be open to the presence of a teacher or mentor in your life. But do not make the grave mistake of openly seeking such a teacher - as the old proverb says, when the student is ready, the teacher will appear.@@br@@ The Hierophant can also represent group activities and beliefs, and in either case, support of the establishment and respect for the rules are emphasized. So if you are planning something revolutionary, the repeated appearance of the Hierophant is a good sign to forget such action and go with the flow for the time being. The traditional way of doing things must work most of the time, or else it wouldn't have been around long enough to become tradition! However, when an idea is proven wrong it is certainly time for a change. The true Hierophant is one who has a deep respect for his beliefs, but who will not blindly follow them to his own ruin. @@br@@ "},
{"image_path":"RWS_Tarot_06_Lovers.jpg","description":"The Lovers card is not just about love and sexuality; it has several meanings which are all related to the duality expressed in the image of the card. The image of the two lovers holding hands or intertwined is a powerful symbol for the harmonious union of two beings, but it also stands for the necessity of proper choice, and some interesting concepts about the relationship of our conscious minds to whatever power brings these lovers together. It should be apparent that, in our culture which has so many words and definitions for the simple emotion of love, the image of love as expressed in the Tarot can have so many meanings.@@br@@ The Lovers is predominantly a card of the emotions, and it often portrays love that is divinely blessed, either by Cupid, an angel, or by God Himself. This seems to imply that nothing but good can come of this union, though with such a dualistic card there is always the potential for a sad conclusion, despite the best of beginnings. After all, love is like a flame because it can ignite the blaze of passion, but also because it can consume and destroy if used carelessly. Love is a wonderful thing, but profane or unrequited love has the power to tear families and lives apart. The Lovers has within it the potential for such love and we must always be cautious of it.@@br@@ Air is the element which rules the Lovers, and we should therefore expect the majority of its meanings to be associated with the spirit and the mind. The notion of choice between positive and negative is first depicted on this card with the old symbology of a man deciding between two lovers. Such a moral crossroads is often shown by the Lovers card, which now tells us to consider all consequences before acting. The situation could be as simple as a fork in the road with two paths to choose between, or a much more complicated decision by which all of our strongest beliefs and ideals will be tested. In times of such difficult choice we clearly need high guidance.@@br@@ The final meaning of the Lovers is perhaps best illustrated by the image of the card in the Rider-Waite deck, and some of its variants. This image shows the man looking at the woman, who in turn looks at the divine figure above them both. The man cannot see the angel, and he must trust the woman to see it for him. Likewise, the conscious mind (the man) cannot directly access Higher Powers (the angel), whatever you believe those are. The unconscious (the woman) must be the bridge between the physical and spiritual planes. This symbology also shows the true power of love; as discussed on the Ten of Cups, through love we can get a glimpse of Heaven.@@br@@ Often, the Lovers will refer to a relationship when it appears in a reading, and when it does, that relationship will be a perfect expression of the love between two people. This will almost always be a sexual relationship, though not necessarily. You must always keep in mind, though, the potential for conflict despite happy beginnings. Love is a flame that must not be left unattended; it must be fueled and allowed to burn for as long and as brightly as possible. If not a physical pairing of man and woman, the Lovers can also show the integration of two conflicting parts of yourself, the masculine and the feminine. Through the combination, greater wisdom is revealed.@@br@@ Finally, this card carries the meaning of choice, usually on the moral or ethical plane. The most familiar instance of such a choice, sadly, is the choice between your spouse and someone else with whom you have fallen in love. Alternatively, it could be between two possible partners, both of whom you love, but only one of whom would be best for you. Look inside, and turn to your unconscious for inspiration. Through it you can access the wisdom needed to make this choice properly, and for the good of all involved. Trust the counsel of your Inner Voice, and once you have made your decision, do not rescind it no matter how much opposition you face. @@br@@ "},
{"image_path":"RWS_Tarot_07_Chariot.jpg","description":"It is somewhat of a mystery why the Chariot, clearly a card of force and of control, should be of the Water element. But its attribution to Cancer is indeed valid because this card deals heavily with the emotions. Specifically, the Chariot is a card of emotional control; the power of the mind to shape the desires of the heart and direct them to meaningful expression. This is not the emotional control of the Emperor, who totally supresses all of his emotions in favor of logic and reason. The man driving the Chariot knows that his emotions are not to be swept under the rug, but trained and used to his greater good.@@br@@ The triumph over both positive and negative emotions is often shown by two horses or sphinxes of different colors pulling the Chariot. Though on their own they would run wild and untamed, going in whichever direction they chose to go, here they move only forward. So they still have some power, but this power has now been directed and focused by the man holding the reins. The chariot cannot move without horses to pull it, just as we cannot function without our emotions to drive us. But without the control of the chariot, the horses would run free, just as our emotions can run wild when unchecked and uncontrolled. Balance is needed.@@br@@ The Chariot embodies the type of discipline that is necessary to gain control over the emotions, and this is why a military symbol has been chosen for this card. The purpose of the harsh conditions of the military is to develop the will and the ability needed to control emotions and put them to productive use on the battlefield. Only through the mastery of yourself can you ever hope to achieve mastery over others and your environment. The wisdom and the glory gained through conquering one's enemies is nothing compared to the self-esteem you build through defeating your fear. Inner enemies are often tougher to defeat than outer ones, and thus teach you much more.@@br@@ Through the application of emotional force we can learn to achieve our goals and desires much more quickly. For someone like the man on the Chariot, who is in total control of his will and his emotions, almost anything is within his grasp. In the Thoth deck, written across the canopy of the Chariot is the word Abracadabra, which may seem foolish at first glance. What is the stage magician's catchphrase doing here - is there magic involved? No, there is no magic. Abracadabra comes from Hebrew, and it translates roughly to \What I have said will be done\ or \As it is said, so it shall be.\ Nothing embodies the spirit of the Chariot more than this word.@@br@@ The appearance of the Chariot often shows a need to take control of your emotions and, instead of wasting energy grieving or complaining, use that energy to take action and to make changes in the world. Fear will cripple you unless, like the Chariot demands, you can acknowledge it and face it. Then you can use your fear constructively, for your own purposes. But this type of control is not limited to the negative emotions. In relationships the Chariot often shows how idle infatuation can be transformed into passion and confidence. Through controlling your emotions, the Chariot says, you will eventually learn to control yourself.@@br@@ And once you have reached that stage, anything is possible! Once you have transcended your fears you start transcending your restrictions until nothing can hold you back from the success you deserve. The Chariot's appearance is often the herald of victory through discipline and confidence, a moment where all opposition lies defeated. Great success and achievements will come to you if you master your passions and believe in the power of your will. Do not let anything distract or sway you from your goals, and proceed with the straight flight of an arrow. Nothing is beyond your ability if you believe in your own power. Abracadabra! @@br@@ "},
{"image_path":"RWS_Tarot_08_Strength.jpg","description":"The title of this card is often misleading because most people tend to think of strength as a property of the physical body. But this is not a card of brute force, because none of the Major Arcana apply directly to the physical body. These are cards of ideas, feeling and beliefs; trying to make a Major Arcanum depicting someone strong of body would be a pointless exercise. But strength is not always measured in terms of how much you can lift or how fast you can run. True Strength is fortitude of character, and the ability to not only control the emotions, but to rise above them, and triumph over all out lower impulses and desires.@@br@@ This card continues the lesson of the Chariot, showing that once we have learned to control emotion, we must rise above it. Many people attribute the notions of forgiveness, compassion and nurturing to this card, but this is clearly not what is shown by Strength. This is a Fire card, and therefore detrimental to all the emotions. The only qualities that abound in Strength are courage and patience. Neither of these are really emotions, but ways of acting and doing that are not tempered by feeling. Courage is the antithesis of fear; patience, the control of worldly desires. There is no emotion here, just determination and action.@@br@@ The symbology of the lion is common to Strength, and aptly so. The lion is the \beast within\, the raging inner desire inside every one of us that must be controlled or it will be set free to manifest in the world. The image of the woman opening the mouth of the lion shows both courage and patience; she must not fear the lion, and she must wait for it to tire before she can exert her own will upon it. This is not an image of compassion in any sense of the word; how can forcing a creature to obey your will be seen as compassionate? Forgiveness and nurturing are likewise not to be seen anywhere in this image. There is just the purity of the maiden and the power of her inner beast that she is attempting to control.@@br@@ She needs patience to defeat the lion because her power is not brute physical force, as mentioned. The force she has is very little, but it can be applied infinitely, and she will continue to apply light but constant pressure until the lion submits to her superior will. It does show a certain determination, and the conviction that even small results will have effects if kept up long enough, just as a constant dripping hollows a stone. So Strength is not a card of compassion and love, but a card of quiet yet unstoppable power. Such power radiates from the soul, and for a consciousness aware of this power, there can be no resistance, and no defeat.@@br@@ The qualities of Strength are already in you, waiting to appear once you have mastered all your base emotions and when you are ready to move on to the spiritual tasks that lie ahead. Its main lesson is that emotions must be transcended if spiritual wisdom and intuition are to be awakened. Whispers from the intuition are often drowned out by the constant roar of emotion and preoccupation and fear. Only once you have eliminated these can the silence you need be created. So conquer your fears, control your impulses, and never lose patience with yourself or what you are doing. Eventually you will see the wisdom of letting go of your lower self.@@br@@ This is not a card of love over hatred, as most would see it. This is simply mind over matter, superior will over inferior desires. No matter how strong the beast within you seems, you have the power to control it and make it submit to your will. This cannot be done with physical force or with undue haste; it is a slow and difficult process. When Strength is around, however, you can be assured that you have enough endurance to see this task through to its eventual end. If you are pushing too hard, Strength shows the need to withdraw for the moment, and be patient. Enlightenment will come only when the time is right; it cannot be rushed. @@br@@ "},
{"image_path":"RWS_Tarot_09_Hermit.jpg","description":"When questions about the nature of existence and the purpose of life start eating away at your mind, answers will not be found in the physical world. They can only be found inside of you. You have risen above your desires and emotions because they will no longer help you on your journey. Now you must become like the Hermit, who seeks the answers alone. Only the whispers of his Inner Voice, and the light of his lamp, will guide him now. Eventually even that lamp shall be cast away, because it is artificial and will not help the Hermit forever. His own inner light must learn to shine in the absence of the light of others.@@br@@ For true wisdom to emerge, there can be no distractions. Any preoccupations of the world, no matter how small or inconsequential they may seem, will be heard as shouts that drown out the still voice within. It is not enough to rid yourself of inner turmoil, though that is a step in the right direction. The next step is to eliminate outer turmoil, through isolation and withdrawal from the world. This is the path of the Hermit, who slips into darkness in order to have the light revealed to him when he is ready. Like the Fool, he is once again alone, separated from all others. But this time it not only by choice, but by necessity.@@br@@ Once he has learned the lessons and seen his true wisdom, the Hermit will often pick up his lamp and return to the real world, in order to help others see their own potential as well. But the Hermit is not a teacher; he will not lecture his students and tell them all about his experiences of solitude and isolation. They must experience it themselves, for wisdom earned simply by listening to another person is not really wisdom at all. True wisdom and true enlightenment always come from within. A teacher may tell the student how he found wisdom, but the student must go and find it for himself. Wisdom is not a gift presented to you on a platter. It is a gift you give yourself. @@br@@ The lessons of life cannot be rushed, or forced, or made to happen before it is time for them to happen. This statement, in fact, is one of those lessons that everyone must learn. But simply reading it on a page, or hearing others tell you about it, will not give you the experience of the lesson. Only by doing - or not doing - can we ever hope to understand. Knowledge only becomes wisdom when we earn it, through the sacrifice of our familiar surroundings and all the people we hold dear. If you think about it logically, everything you leave behind when you follow the Hermit's call will remain when you return. The only thing that will have changed is you.@@br@@ The appearance of the Hermit is a call to learn more about yourself and the nature of your existence, and everyone experiences this call at some point in their lives. Take this as a sign that your worldly problems and affairs can safely be put on hold; there is greater, inner work to be done now. Often this will refer to a problem you must solve or a part of your nature you must deal with before a situation can progress. Only in rare circumstances will this refer to a spiritual transformation, but when it does, know that it will be a powerful change requiring much effort and commitment. A more long-term withdrawal may be needed.@@br@@ The Hermit can also show you that a mentor is entering your life. This is a person who will not teach you overtly, but who will show you how to find the answers you are seeking within yourself. Perhaps you will be the mentor who is indicated by the Hermit, in which case you must be careful not to preach to your student, but guide him. Your wisdom will not be your student's, and you must accept that before any teaching can be done. If you are ever in doubt, know that all the wisdom you will need is already inside you, waiting to emerge. This light will not come unless sought out, but when it does, you will see that you had the answers all along. @@br@@ "},
{"image_path":"RWS_Tarot_10_Wheel_of_Fortune.jpg","description":"The Wheel of Fortune is a type of energy that stands beyond the realm of our understanding and control. Certainly you can experience its effects in life, like you feel the pull of gravity on your body. But just as you can see the apple falling but not the gravity pulling on it, so too are the works of Fate and Destiny invisible to us. Only their results can be seen, and even then, only when Destny itself decrees that the time is right for its effects to be manifested. Unlike the majority of the Major Arcana, the Wheel of Fortune hovers in the clouds, showing that you can try to reach it, but that you can never fully understand it.@@br@@ The wheel is an apt symbol for the forces of Destiny and Fate because it shows how everything is connected in a cycle; some might call it the circle of life. Everything happens in cycles; we rise and fall just as a spot on the perimeter of a wheel travels from the highest point, through all the possible points on the wheel, and then back to the apex. However changes will affect you depends on where you are on the wheel. If you are at the top then any change could throw you off, but if you are the bottom then a change could start you back up to the top. And for one person to rise another must fall - everyone is connected.@@br@@ Destiny seems to strike without warning, but often its effects can be seen coming if you know where and how to look for them. This is the principle of the Tarot and divinatory systems in general; to see things coming before they happen so you can prepare. Obviously if you see a wheel with the Sphinx on the top, Typhon the snake on the left, and Hermanubis on the lower right, and you know which way the wheel is turning, you can tell where each of the three figures is going - and you can also tell where they've been. Through careful extrapolation the effects of Destiny become less mysterious, and someday everyone may grasp this idea.@@br@@ This cyclical structure of Fate is perhaps the only way to really understand how Fate manifests. The conclusion of a situation is found in its beginning, just as the number 10 of the Wheel of Fortune reduces to 1 by the addition of its digits. When you can realize that each beginning leads to an ending, and that each ending is both the results of one beginning and the freshly planted seed of another, then you will have grasped the essential notion of the Wheel of Fortune. And once that notion is grasped, the universe opens up to you, because you are ready to learn all its wisdom. The first hurdle has been passed and greater lessons lie ahead.@@br@@ The appearance of the Wheel of Fortune shows that change is not only likely to happen, it is certain to happen, and soon. The nature of that change and the effects it has really depend on how much you understand the concepts of Fate, and whether or not you can prepare for it. Generally the change shown in the Wheel of Fortune is a dramatic change from the established order. So if you have been scraping along for a while, expect big changes in your favor within a few days. But if you've been feeling on top of the world for a long time, batten down the hatches and keep an eye out for storms - one is bound to hit you sooner or later.@@br@@ No matter which way the Wheel of Fortune throws you, it's impossible to try and change it, so you might as well try to live with it. If a crisis seems inevitable, recall that in every crisis lies opportunity. When you've been swept in new direction, know that every path leads somewhere, even if you don't know where it is. When times are bad, or when times are good, always keep in mind that they won't last forever. Such events are just out of your control, and if you can accept that then the ride gets a lot easier. If you struggle against the Wheel it will crush you. So roll along with it! @@br@@ "},
{"image_path":"RWS_Tarot_11_Justice.jpg","description":"Since the Major Arcana do not apply directly to physical life, it must follow that Justice does not apply to the laws made by mankind. True, sometimes the laws of mankind mimic the laws that Justice does enforce, and in those rare cases Justice can indeed refer to them. But Justice typically refers to the immutable laws of the Universe, the invisible principles that keep everything flowing forward smoothly through infinite causal chains. These are laws that cannot be violated; only enforced. And the sword of Justice, double-edged as always, is ready to mete out punishment for those who have wronged, and to reward those who have done good deeds.@@br@@ The two most important laws governed by Justice are really two sides of the same coin. First comes the law of cause and effect, stating that all events are connected and each present state is the result of all past states. This is a such strange idea to get your mind around because sometimes seemlingly meaningless actions will have great ramifications. Justice shows that every action you do will eventually have an effect, someday, and you really have no idea of knowing what that event is until it happens. Often the figure on the Justice card is pictured sitting in front of a curtain; this curtain hides the machinations of the universe that bring about these final results.@@br@@ From the law of cause and order develops the law of Karma, showing that all your actions will return to you eventually. They will be modified slightly, and they are often strengthened over time, but the lesson is still the same. As you sow, so shall you reap. This is really a simple elaboration of the law of cause and effect. Under this new law, not only will everything you do have an effect, everything you do will have an effect on you. This is where it becomes critical to be mindful of your actions, because everything you take will come back to you eventually. Before Justice, you have to answer for all your actions, right and wrong. Life, if nothing else, is fair.@@br@@ Indeed, Justice teaches the fairest yet cruelest lesson of all because, like in the suit of Swords, her blade has a double edge. You do not get what you expect, or even what you want - you get what you deserve. If you deserve good things then they are awarded, without ceremony or congratulation. If you deserve punishment then it is given with neither compassion nor mockery. You simply get back what you have made for yourself. And since you cannot change your actions once they have been made, if you want good things to happen you must be constantly making choices that will lead to those good things. You can be a saint or a demon - it is your choice.@@br@@ When Justice appears, it should be taken as a stern reminder that the deeds of the past form the foundation for the events of the present and the future. If, in the past, you did something that you have been feeling guilty about, now may be the day when you have to answer for your deeds. If you did a deed you felt was worthy of reward, perhaps that reward will arrive. Especially when the Justice card is around, mind your actions and make sure you don't do anything you might regret later. Justice often appears to warn you that she will meet you again soon if you stay on your current path. Whether this is good or not remains yours to decide.@@br@@ Despite the fact that it rarely represents the decisions of judges, this card can sometimes personify the attitude of a good judge. You may wish to take on this attitude to solve a problem in your life. The archetypal judge shown by Justice is not the blind courtroom statuette, but a figurehead of fairness and authority. Be right and reasonable in all your judgements - never take sides, never show mercy but never show excessive severity either. And before you judge others you must be prepared to judge yourself, and ensure that you are not guilty of the same errors as they. Righting any wrongs in your past must be done before you can attempt to right wrongs in your present. @@br@@ "},
{"image_path":"RWS_Tarot_12_Hanged_Man.jpg","description":"The Hanged Man is the only Tarot card visibly based on a mythological figure. He is Odin, the Norse god who hung from the World Tree for nine days to earn the knowledge of the Runes. Of all the cultures who embody the search for knowledge in their myths, only Odin carries out his quest without moving, at least in the physical sense. The true quest is seeking within, not without. This may be confusing at first, but only because the Hanged Man is the card of the paradox. The Hanged Man's mysteries are some of the oddest yet most enlightening the Tarot has to offer, and they cannot be learned by searching for lessons in the physical world - you must turn within.@@br@@ Even the appearance of the card is paradoxical. Simple in design, it is one of the more complex Arcana. The lessons it offers are easy to understand but hard to accept when they apply to you. The most obvious answer to a problem may be the simplest, but it is rarely the best. To admit that you are afraid will give you the strength to conquer your fear. When you relinquish your desire for control, everything begins to work as it should. In a world in which you must run as fast as you can to stay where you are, the Hanged Man tells you to stop struggling - and you can move forward. Tell this to others and it seems obvious; try to do it yourself and it will become impossible.@@br@@ Why is this? Telling others that they have to hang from a tree is simple, but no one wants to hang himself. The Hanged Man, however, has hung himself, and see how much wisdom he has found! Despite his obviously uncomfortable position, he is often pictured as smiling, and with a golden halo around his head to show divine inspiration and power. He is totally vulnerable to the world, and in his vulnerability he has found strength. The sacrifice he has made is his own freedom and power in the physical world; in exchange, he is granted real freedom and power on the spiritual plane. He gives up his old ways of looking at things and is blessed with new eyes.@@br@@ Not all sacrifices have to be like this, of course. Each moment of your life you make sacrifices. By choosing to eat with a friend rather than eating alone, you sacrifice your solitude. Choosing to play a sport professionally means that you cannot play another as frequently. Choosing one job means that you have to sacrifice any desires for another job, at least for the time being. The only thing in common between all sacrifices is that you give up something you have in exchange for something you want, of equal value. The sacrifice is meaningless unless there is balance and purpose behind it. To give without intent is worse than giving too much or too little.@@br@@ As the card of the paradox, the Hanged Man also urges you to look at things in a new and different way. If your mind is yelling at you to do something, then doing nothing could be the best thing to do. If something is important to you emotionally but it no longer serves a purpose, you might want to think about letting go of it. And don't try to force anything to happen while the Hanged Man is about. By trying to force changes, you ensure that they never happen. Relax and let things happen instead of trying to interfere. Instead of fighting against the current, let it take you wherever it is flowing.@@br@@ When the Hanged Man appears, know that greater wisdom and happiness is at hand, but only if you are prepared to sacrifice something for that wisdom. Sometimes it is something physical you must be deprived of, but in most cases it is a perspective or a viewpoint that must be left behind. For example, a fantasy that you can never fulfill, or a crush on someone who's out of your reach. Inevitably, sacrificing something you value will always lead you to something even more valuable. In the wake of an unattainable dream you will find something else within your reach. Forgetting about one love will allow your heart to open to someone else. @@br@@ "},
{"image_path":"RWS_Tarot_13_Death.jpg","description":"The image of Death charging across a field on his spectral steed would strike fear into the heart of almost any man. The appearance of the Death card has a similar effect on most people, though it really should not. Whether you like it or not, Death is one of the most powerful cards in the Tarot. Humans naturally fear the unknown, and so Death is our greatest fear since it is the greatest unknown. The majority of us are unaware that our mind and spirit die all the time, constantly shedding old beliefs and acquiring new ones. It has been said many times by many readers: the Death card is not a card of death - it is a card of transformation.@@br@@ In the Tarot, as in reality, Death is nothing more than a transition to the next level of life. Whether you believe that a soul goes to heaven or back to Earth to be reincarnated, the fact remains that the soul lives on. The candle is extinguished, but only because the day has come. The river shown on many versions of the Death card is a symbol, showing that life will go on, no matter what disastrous things happen. The river water will reach the sea, rise into the clouds, then rain onto the land to flow into the river again. Nothing is destroyed, because nothing can be destroyed - there can be only transformation.@@br@@ The only real reason the transformation shown by Death is so catastrophic is because it is being held back, fought against by those too afraid to realize that change is beneficial. Every change happens for a reason, and Death is a force like Justice in that it is absolutely fair. It does not discriminate against one group and spare another - everyone is equal in the eyes of Death. So if big changes are happening in your life it is certainly plausible that you are the reason for them. There's no point fighting death, it only makes things worse. Like the Hanged Man, accept that change happens and let it do what it must.@@br@@ Take a look at the Rider-Waite version of the Death card, and note the bishop on the right side of the image. He is actually welcoming Death, because he knows of the great spiritual transformation it brings. Almost all versions of the Death card show a symbol of resurrection or re-birth. This could be the rising sun, an egg, or a sapling sprouting from the body of a dead man. All these symbols show that to progress in life, our old form must die, just as a snake sheds its old skin to reveal a shiny new one. This is the message of the card: Death must be conquered by the regeneration of the soul, and he who knows this shall live forever.@@br@@ When the Death card appears, big changes are heading your way. Usually this change refers to something in your lifestyle; an old attitude or perspective is no longer useful and you have to let go of it. While the Hanged Man was a card of voluntary sacrifice, the Death card is a forced sacrifice - but that does not mean that it is not for your own good. Sometimes you cannot see how your attitudes are hurting you, and when that is true, the Death card is your wake-up call. Death is not simply destruction; it is destruction followed by renewal. Even though one door may have closed, another is opening. Will you have the courage to step through?@@br@@ If so, before you go forward, take a moment to look back. Is there anything that you are carrying with you that is no longer necessary? Let it go now, before you proceed. Are your old attitudes holding you back, or are high expectations constantly disappointing you? Cast them off, or let Death's watery energy wash them away from you. Open yourself and let it strip away all that you no longer need - fear, revenge, intolerance. Flowers cannot bloom if the land is full of weeds which choke the ground, and likewise, your spiritual enlightenment will be held back by doubt and fear. Let them go now or risk having them painfully ripped away when Death inevitably returns. @@br@@ "},
{"image_path":"RWS_Tarot_14_Temperance.jpg","description":"After the purging experience of Death, it is necessary to rebuild and improve on that which has been left over. Now that old habits and beliefs are gone forever, new attitudes must be acquired to fill the gaps and make you whole again. This process of reconstruction and harmonization is shown by the card called Temperance. The verb \to temper\ means to modify or strengthen by adding a new component to an existing substance or mixture, and this broad defintion can be applied to many areas of your life. But all applications of Temperance share the common theme of moderation and balance, culminating in the creation of a centered and well-rounded being.@@br@@ In most Tarot decks the red-on-white symbology first shown in the Magician appears on the card in some form. The temperance of desire (red) with purity (white) is one of the most fundamental manifestations of this card, as is the reverse (purity with desire). The angel on the Rider-Waite deck, who wears a white robe and has red wings, is a perfect illustration of this. Purity of heart and mind gives you a solid base to fall back upon, but only through the desire for personal growth can you ever develop. The angel's white robes give him his basic form, but only through the control of his red wings comes his ability to fly.@@br@@ The act of Temperance can also refer to the coming together of two distinct beings that must function as one. Obviously this refers to relationships, but also to friendships, partnerships, and all kinds of compromises and committees. This can also take place on an internal level, when you confront your deepest desires and your most irrational fears and, instead of getting rid of them, you incorporate them into yourself and grow stronger because of the temperance. If you throw away your Shadow it cannot help you, but by accepting it you bring it under your control. Perfect harmony with oneself is one of the two lessons of this card, and the one often seen in readings. @@br@@ Temperance also represents an appreciation of moderation through experience of the extremes; to use an analogy, to live through the darkest night and the brightest day to appreciate both the twilight and the dawn. Only through seeing and acknowledging both sides - the positive and the negative - can you integrate both into your personality. Another facet of the Temperance card is that you must not strive to become totally positive, even though that might seem like a good goal. Life seeks balance and if you strive to be a totally positive being you will be fighting the current all the way. Better to embrace moderation and go with the flow.@@br@@ The two situations in which Temperance will most often appear are in the context of your relationships with others and with yourself. In the former case, a need for balance is often implied. Conflict can only be resolved through compromise and cooperation, and two people who both acknowledge this cannot be in conflict for long, because they always balance things out before they become problematic. Likewise, they enjoy the good times but know that they cannot last forever, and are not disappointed on darker days. If a relationship seems out of balance in any way, Temperance must be taken as a sign to start fixing things before it gets too far out of balance and it is irrevocably destroyed.@@br@@ Often, though, before you can achieve harmony in your relationships with the people around you, you must make peace with yourself. Inner imbalances can often manifest in the physical world if they are not attended to, whether or not the imbalance is a negative one. Having a lifestyle that is optimistic to the point of believing yourself to be invincible will lead to problems, maybe even more so than a lifestyle of pessimism and paranoia. Balance is best achieved through turning to the Inner Voice for guidance. Temperance is a card of health, and its appearance shows that your inner power is ready to heal you and make you stronger. @@br@@ "},
{"image_path":"RWS_Tarot_15_Devil.jpg","description":"The Devil is another of the popularly misunderstood cards of the Tarot, perhaps second only to Death in this category. In our modern world we do not like to think that there is a seed of negativity in everyone, so we assume that anything bad that happens must be the work of some outside Devil, who is to be feared and shunned. But really, people do not do bad things because a force outside them is controlling their actions. They do bad things because the negative part of their own personality is expressing itself. To deny this side of yourself is to give it power over you, and to give it free reign over your life will eventually destroy you.@@br@@ The symbolic portrayal of the Devil in the Tarot is a clear mockery of two previous Major Arcana, the Lovers and the Hierophant. The former parody is perhaps the more obvious. Where the angel hovers on the Lovers, the Devil stands on his card, cursing the man and woman rather than blessing them. They who were once connected to each other by love are now attached to the Devil by their chains of lust and ignorance. The Devil's hand mimics the gesture of the Hierophant, but perverts it. The true Hierophant offers spiritual wisdom and beckons to us with an open hand. The Devil's gesture hides his true intentions of hurtful wisdom - not really wisdom at all.@@br@@ It must be stressed again that the Devil is not a force that attacks from without, but a cancer than devours you from within. When the Devil is in power everything turns upside-down; hence, the inverted Pentagram associated with him. When you submit to your inner Devil, you simultaneously submit to every other force in the outside world that would do you harm. You allow others to bind you and control your life. You allow your creative powers to be corrupted and turned against you. But through all of this you are not a victim of anyone but yourself. In fact, in a sense you are not really a victim at all, and certainly not helpless.@@br@@ The most important lesson the Devil teaches you is that you can free yourself from whatever restrictions are holding you back, at any time you choose to. The chains that bind the figures on the Devil card are loose enough to be thrown off at any time. There is still positive energy within you that you can tap to break free - but only if you can let go of the materialism and that the Devil embodies. In the end, the best way to free yourself of the Devil's bondage is not to submit to it, but to accept it as the shadow that must be cast wherever there is light. Having accepted the shadow, you can look to the light.@@br@@ When the Devil card appears in a reading it usually shows that you are not in control of your life, sometimes as a result of your own actions, but more often as a byproduct of inaction. This loss of control often leads to loss of hope, and a lack of faith in your own abilities. Sometimes ignorance and materialism are the tools of the Devil, and those traits will be evident if you focus on worldly possessions and power while ignoring the spiritual power you have inside of you. As a result, your creativity and energy can be seriously impaired, and you may not wish to regain control of yourself.@@br@@ Your own mindset is a critical factor when the Devil card appears. If you think darkness has won, it has. If you are willing to let others exploit and restrain you, then they can and they will. But no one has power over you unless you give it away. If you are willing to release yourself from the chains of ignorance, you can do so, and you can step into the light. Turn all that negative energy into positive energy and see how much you can accomplish when you believe you can. Take a good long look at yourself and try to see what you could not see before. Always remember, that shadow cannot exist without light, and that there is no Devil except the one you create. @@br@@ "},
{"image_path":"RWS_Tarot_16_Tower.jpg","description":"Sometimes, when accepted and welcomed, divine wisdom and enlightenment flow freely like a calm river. The rest of the time, wisdom is blocked until it rages forth like a tidal wave and crushes anything in its path, including the recipient of the wisdom. This is the energy of the Tower card, an energy very similar to Death in that it is both a destructive and a creative force. When a building is old and decrepit, it must be demolished so that a new structure may stand in its place. The same is true of the symbolic Tower. When old attitudes and beliefs are outdated, you will have to let go of them, whether you like it or not.@@br@@ In most cases, the latter is true - you do not want to give up your ideals, and you cling to them like a child to his preciou security blanket. This attempt at security ensures nothing, really, except a disastrous change that will painfully rip away that which you did not discard of your own volition. But there is a greater purpose at work here. The power of the soul and the mind is far greater than the energy of some physical thing, and it can be taken with you anywhere and always. To extend the security blanket analogy, the blanket must be taken away so the child can find power and security within himself, instead of within some material object.@@br@@ When you believe material objects are more powerful than spirit and mind, you start building up a Tower of falsehoods on a very unstable foundation. If, by some miracle of engineering, it does not collapse under its own weight, you will eventually push it over yourself. The Tower falls not because Fate says so but because something within can no longer endure the strain it must bear. Sooner or later it will give out. This is a humbling experience because its lesson is that no one is invincible. The problem for most people is that they concentrate on the negatives and ignore the great opportunity that has been given to them.@@br@@ The fire of the Tower card burns away all that is negative and outdated, but it leaves behind all that is positive, all that is necessary to begin your life again and replace all that was lost. In essence, this is the energy of Death and Temperance combined, because sweeping-away and building-up both happen at about the same time on the Tower. As soon as the tumbling figures on the Rider-Waite card land on the jagged rocks of reality, they are greeted with the influx of wisdom that they need to survive. And with that wisdom in hand, they can take the first step back on the true path to enlightenment: building a mental Tower to Heaven rather than a physical one.@@br@@ When wisdom must be forced upon you, or when ignorance must be taken away, the Tower will appear to let you prepare yourself. If you choose to let go of what you no longer need, and accept what you do need, things will go much more smoothly and without frustration. If you ignore the warning of the Tower, however, and cling to the status quo, be prpared for a downfall. You have been oversleeping and this is your spiritual wake-up call. When the Tower is in the area, know that anything that seems secure could not really be safe at all. If a change is destined to happen, to not try to fight it, because all change happens because it is needed.@@br@@ On an inner level, the destruction of Tower is akin to the breaking-down of the fortress called the ego. When you build a wall to hide your secrets or to conceal your true self, you must know that sooner or later the wall will come tumbling down. Fantasies are particularly prone to being shattered by the power of this card; the Tower dissipates them like sunlight burning away fog. Fantasies and daydreams will not help where you are going so it is best to let go of them now. Do not place your faith in illusions of security; the crown on this card must be worn on by a human head, not placed atop a tower of cold stone. @@br@@ "},
{"image_path":"RWS_Tarot_17_Star.jpg","description":"Whenever all hope seems lost, it will reappear to prove that you have really lost nothing, except perhaps your sight of the path to enlightenment. And in the absence of that sight, the Star will light your way. Its light is not a blinding flash like the lightning bolt of the Tower, but a soft radiating glow that warms and comforts, rather than burning and destroying. You must remember that both of these energies ultimately come from the same place in the sky - from Heaven. After the light of the Tower destroys the false path you were following, the kinder and gentler light of the Star will lead you back to the right path.@@br@@ In terms of symbolism this card is similar to Temperance; there is a figure by a pool with two cups. But while the contents of the Cups were mixed with each other in Temperance, here they are mixed with the waters of the eternal spirit of the Divine. When you cannot help yourself, the Star tells you to look to the heavens for guidance. Or, more appropriately, look to the spark of divinity that lies within yourself that you could not see or acknowledge before. Each of us has a little piece of the Star deep inside, waiting to cast its light into the world to light the way. This is what Crowley meant when he affirmed that \every man and every woman is a star.\@@br@@ The Star is a card of faith, both in your own power, and in powers greater than your own. When the Tower sweeps away all the negativity in your life, you once again need something to fill the void, and faith is a good place to start. What exactly is faith? It could be said that faith is a conscious belief in an unconscious experience, of which we may not be directly aware, but of which we can still feel the effects. This definition fits both belief in a deity and belief in your own abilities. Having faith in any power will allow that power to manifest in your life. Beleiving that something will happen is as sure a way as any to make it happen.@@br@@ There is a lot of meditative imagery on almost all renditions of the Star, though the most interesting symbol on the Rider-Waite version of the card is the pool of water at the center of the scene. On some decks the naked woman is standing in the pool, but in the Rider-Waite version she kneels beside it. Notice that her right foot rests on the water but does not break the surface. Once faith is placed in its power, the pool of the subconscious becomes able to support the conscious mind. The miraculous ability to walk on water is symbolically translated here into the ability to trust in another power, whether in the heavens or in yourself. Once that trust is achieved, anything is possible.@@br@@ There are few cards more positive than the Star, because when it appears in your life it is nothing less than a beacon of hope and inspiration. In times of darkness it shows that there is a way out, and tells you not to worry, for illumination and freedom are at hand. All you need is something in which to place your faith. So trust in yourself, and in whatever powers you believe control the universe, to help you through difficult times. Let the infinite energy of the Star warm you and rejuvenate your soul, to provide the strength and the clarity of purpose you need to continue on your journey.@@br@@ It is important to keep in mind, however, that the Star is never a card that shows the final solution to any problem. It simply shows the hope and faith to get to wherever you're going; without hope we can accomplish nothing, but hope is only a beginning. Now that you have been inspired, you still have much work to do in order to bring your vision into manifestation. You must combine the solidity of material existence with the waters of your emotions and of your spirit. This is a time when miracles can happen, so kick off your shoes and wade into the pool, confident that the water will support you until you reach the other side. @@br@@ "},
{"image_path":"RWS_Tarot_18_Moon.jpg","description":"It has been said many times that things are not always as they seem, and in the influence of the Moon this axiom is particularly true. In the moonlight, things that are benevolent during the day can suddenly seem dangerous and malicious. The very term \moonlight\ is misleading because the Moon does not emit light of its own, it simply reflects the light of the Sun. Some people even claim to see the face of a man on the Moon's cratered surface, though of course such a thing is impossible and only an illusion. A lot of people who look for that face in the Moon know it could not be there, but they look nonetheless.@@br@@ This card is one of the few Major Arcana with important animal symbolism, and with no human figures in the majority of cases. The Rider-Waite card shows a wolf and a dog; two members of the same genus, but the first is wild and the second has been domesticated. Both of them are shown howling at the Moon, however, and if a human were present in this scene he would probably be affected somehow too. Regardless of your place in the hierarchy of society or of evolution, you are still susceptible to illusions and deception. The Moon shines the same light down on everyone, though what you see when that light reaches your eyes depends on who you are, not on what you see.@@br@@ In ancient religions the Moon deity was often a Goddess with ties to female fertility, because there was a visible correlation between the cycle of the Moon and the female menstrual cycle. While this association is still valid, the Moon of the Tarot tends to deal with fertility of imagination rather than fertility of body. The crayfish shown regularly on Moon cards is a sign of the emerging subconscious and its influence over the conscious mind, and for a mind closed to the messages of its subconscious, there can be a lot of illusion and deceptions to face. You can no longer tell what is real and what is just a manifestation of your fears and desires.@@br@@ The ordeal of the Moon is the last challenge posed by the Major Arcana, in which you must travel in the dark, not knowing for sure if your path is the right one. There is no sunlight to guide you, no distant landmark in the hills to direct your steps, no one to travel alongside. This is a journey that must be made alone, in darkness and without a map or a compass. You must learn to rely on your own inner light to lead you along the true path. Any hesitation, any doubt, and that light will be extinguished forever. But if you believe, your light will shine forever, as brightly as the sun that will inevitably rise once this night has passed.@@br@@ The Moon's appearance in a reading almost always means that something is not as it appears to be, and that vigilance and perception will be necessary to find that which is hidden before it is too late. In a generally good reading the Moon shows that not all is as wonderful as you would think. You may be idealizing the sitatuion, and ignoring the fact that potential for failure exists among success. A negative reading that includes the Moon often shows that you are letting your imagination run away with you, and that things are not nearly as bad as they seem. In both cases you must open your eyes and see what it really going on.@@br@@ This card can also show times when you are not sure of your destination, or even of the path you are travelling - but you travel nonetheless. It's quite possible that you have lost your way, and are stumbling around in the dark. If you wait until the sun rises again the path may have changed and the opportunity could have been lost. So what should you do? The Moon is a card of intuition and psychic forces, so let go of your conscious mental blocks and let your intuition guide you. Not only will the way forward be revealed, but in a lot of cases you will learn lessons about yourself that will be valuable in later journeys. @@br@@ "},
{"image_path":"RWS_Tarot_20_Judgement.jpg","description":"The card originally known as Judgement Day derives from Christian scripture, but in most religions and cultures there is the concept of spiritual rebirth after the end of the world. This is another card of transition, like Death and the Tower, but its energy is neither violent nor catastrophic despite the fact that its power is far greater. This is the energy of creation without destruction, impossible on the material plane but certainly possible in the world of the spirit. There is rebirth not through discarding negativity, but through integration of all parts of the self. The spirit is cleansed and restored without loss or addition. It remains the same, but different.@@br@@ Traditionally, Judgement Day is a day of reckoning, where you must answer for your actions and your inactions. The tie to Justice cannot be missed, and in a sense, Judgement is an elaboration on cause and effect, and on the notion of cosmic justice. In the light of Judgement the effects of your actions and inactions do not exact a toll or give a reward on the physical plane, but on the spiritual level. Where you have been determines where you are going, and what you have done plays a role in what you still must do. The cycle can never really end because the spirit never dies, but lies on in an eternal existence that we may never fully comprehend.@@br@@ As the Judgement Day represents the union of the material and spiritual world into a single unit of manifestation, so too can Judgement show the union or reconciliation of the different parts of yourself. The three human figures found on most versions of the card allude to this. The man represents the renewal of the conscious mind, the woman is the rebirth of the subconscious, and the child is the boy from the Sun, the eternal child in us all. United into one voice, they praise the angel that appears in the sky. After the non-destructive cleansing and restoration of Judgement, matter, mind and spirit are one - now and forever.@@br@@ The Rider-Waite symbolism is particularly interesting. In the background are the mountains that first appeared on the Fool. The ocean is the termination of the river that flows through the Major Arcana, starting with the Empress. Gabriel's banner is red on white, the same as the Magician's robes. As with everything in life, the beginning is woven irrevocably into the end and the end will eventually lead to a new beginning. At its core, Judgement is not a card of endings, but of beginnings. This journey is over but the next, a journey on a higher plane of existence, is approaching. Judgement is the preparation for that journey; the last stop before eternity.@@br@@ Judgement's appearance in a reading often signals that a major change is heading your way, but unlike Death and the Tower, the change will not be a destructive one. The change is under your control, and in fact you can even turn your back on it if you wish. In time, however, you will likely regret doing so - this is another lesson of Judgement. Decisions such as the one it offers are necessary to growth and spiritual development, and you cannot run from them forever. The day of reckoning will come someday, and you will have to admit where you have gone wrong in order to receive rewards you deserve. @@br@@ Judgement is also a card of cleansing, representing a time where your slate is wiped clean and you can start over, with all your debts taken care of and with nothing to worry about. This may seem too good to be true, and for a lot of people it is, because they ruin their new chance with thoughts of the mistakes they made in the past. Judgement teaches that while you must be aware of the past and the lessons you have learned, you must not degrade yourself because of mistakes - mistakes are just part of learning! Put the past behind you and look to the future, ready to begin again. Now is time for a definite step, so don't let the shadows of the past hold you back. @@br@@ "},
{"image_path":"RWS_Tarot_21_World.jpg","description":"After every obstacle has been faced and surmounted, after every path has been travelled and charted, there remains only the last step to the next level of existence - the World, the final gateway. After the union of the conscious and unconscious, the mind and the body, in Judgement, all that can remain is union with the Divine in whatever form it appears to you. This journey is over and the next is only beginning. The cycle is complete as last, with the vindication of the traveler and the immortality he has gained through development of the self. It would seem that the Fool's Journey may not have been so foolish after all.@@br@@ This card, as befits its nature, has the same basic symbolism in almost all of its myriad version. There are the four cherubs embodying their domains; The bull for matter, the lion for energy, the eagle for time and the man for space. Together they represent the unifed creation and control of all things in the Universe. Another common motif is the dancer in the centre, with her twin wands. The wand is that of the Magician, but it has now multiplied, and the need to ground its magical power has vanished because it has become one with its source of power. Positive and negative can be seen as two parts of the same whole. One is many. Many are one.@@br@@ The World could be thought of as a time of rest, the time between death and life where the soul awaits reincarnation in the material world and - for the briefest of periods - becomes one with the universe from which it came. All the lessons learned have been put to use. All the tasks accomplished have born fruit and brought prosperity. Every cause has had its effects and all of the diverse threads of effects have been woven into a tapestry of your life as you have lived it. Now is a time to enjoy your wisdom, savour your prosperity and admire the personal artwork you have created, for soon you will start it all over again.@@br@@ The journey may have stopped for the moment, and it may have transcended the plane on which you started, but the journey of the soul never ends. A new beginning is found in the end, the pieces are in place for a new journey to start, and after that one is completed, another will surely commence. After a glimpse of the Divine you return to manifestation, sure of your convictions and in your ability to someday see the face of God again. The cycle is as endless as the wreath that surrounds the scene, tied together by the ribbons of Divine force, and spiraling around the universe until the end of time.@@br@@ The World card marks a time in your life in which one cycle is over and the next is just beginning. It represents the final achievement of all your worldly expectations and desires, and the immenent approach of new desires to follow and new goals to puruse. The World itself remains the ultimate goal, because it is an affirmation of life and an arrival at a perfect state of harmony and bliss. This is the confirmation of success and the reward for all your trials and ordeals. With the coming of the World comes assured success and material well-being, as well as emotional fulfillment, and growth in the spiritual sense.@@br@@ In the material world, this card's energy often manifests as a promotion to a higher position or an initiation to a new level of knowledge that was only dreamed of before. But this time of rejoicing and happiness, this peak of ecstasy, merely gives us a glimpse of the next mountain on the horizon. So once again you must step up ot the cliff and leap off, ready to start a new Fool's journey and find what secrets lie in this new level of existence. The cycle of the Major Arcana begins where it ends and ends where it begins; start and finish are no longer the ends of straight line, but coincident points on the circumference of a circle that encapsulates your life. The present is now. The future is now. Eternity is now. @@br@@ "},
{"image_path":"Swords01.jpg","description":"In the right hands, the sword is a powerful weapon that can serve the needs of justice and authority. But the sword cuts both ways, and when in the posession of those who seek to use it for evil, its power becomes wholly negative. Every Sword card in the Tarot bears the duality but the Ace is particularly susceptible to it. It is the beginning, the spark of potential that will influence all that lies ahead. The Sword by itself can never be positive or negative. The bearer of the sword determines whether he will wield it with clarity and truth of purpose, or with anger and agression.@@br@@ The Ace of Swords shows the beginning of a situation whose potential is as double-edged as the blade of a sword. There is great power, even excessive power at times, in both love and hatred. The Ace implies the use of such power to further one's ends, but what it does not imply is the manner in which those powers will be used, or the end that the means seek to achieve. No matter what the goal, there is always great power behind the attempts to reach it when these attempts are powered by the Ace of Swords. Very little can stand in the path of this energy without being destroyed.@@br@@ Unlike the force of the Ace of Wands, a natural force, the force of this Ace can be invoked and wielded by anyone whose heart is strong. Note that, in many cases, strength and purity do not necessarily go hand in hand. Weapons are borne by the violent and unjust much more often than the righteous, and this is perhaps why the Swords suit as a whole is full of grief and crisis. But the Ace does not show either triumph or defeat; it has the potential for both lying within it. It is up to the bearer of the Sword to tap that great potential, and it is his actions that decide what will become of it.@@br@@ As a primarily spiriutal card, the Ace of Swords often represents an insight or a breakthrough in the world of the spirit. Lucid understanding and mental reasoning reach their peak under the influence of this card, and achievement of goals suddenly becomes a lot easier. You can clear away the fog that has kept you from seeing the inner truth, and you can cut away all the bonds of the past that have held you back. The time to act is now, and if you set your mind to accomplishing your goals, you can achieve anything you desire. But be careful that you do not cut yourself with the sword's two-edged blade. @@br@@ "},
{"image_path":"Swords02.jpg","description":"The inherent duality of the Swords suit is shown here as the delicate balance of the two swords. The Two of Swords expresses this balance as a stalemate, a conflict between two equally matched forces in which neither has the clear advantage. These forces can take on many forms: negative against positive, the impulse to act against the desire to stay silent, or knowing what to do against actually doing it. Such impasses are not easily resolved, and they can lead to a long period of confusion and stagnation. So we have peace, but in this situation peace is detrimental.@@br@@ Since the swords are crossed in front of the woman's heart on the Rider-Waite Two of Swords, this card often manifests as a closed heart. This expression refers to one of the many barriers that are erected around you to protect you from what you perceive as dangers. In this case the swords are not forces opposed against each other, but forces allied against anything that might try to pry them away and reveal what they are guarding. If the barrier is broken suddenly, it will be painful. But if the barrier is allowed to remain it will become stronger and tension will build until it breaks on its own.@@br@@ In a relationship-oriented situation the Two of Swords shows such barriers between the two partners. Sometimes only one person is responsible, but the number of the card suggests that both partners are at fault in the majority of cases. It manifests as a vicious cycle; one partner refuses to tell a secret and becomes defensive. The other partner is hurt and becomes equally defensive. This continues until the relationship falls apart or the tension is relieved, and such relief cannot come about through further defensiveness. The barriers cannot be shattered; they must be taken down piece by piece. And sometimes this is very uncomfortable to do.@@br@@ The Two of Swords often represents situations where an answer could be found and the truth could be seen, but where the person or persons involved choose not to see it. The Two of Swords shows those times when you deliberately avoid seeing the truth. Maybe one of your ideas has been proven incorrect and, though you see that you were wrong, you do not want to admit it. It can be painful to remove a blindfold and see the truth, because even the softest light will blind those who have lived in darkness. But being blinded by the light is far preferable to being blinded by darkness. @@br@@ "},
{"image_path":"Swords03.jpg","description":"The symbolism on the Three of Swords is scant but powerful, almost universal in its depiction on various decks. Three swords are seen piercing a heart, or occasionnally a flower, both of which are symbols of emotion and beauty. Thus the Three of Swords depicts, rather unambiguously, the ability of logic and power to harm the physical body and the emotions of a person. It is not surprising that many people don't like this card because of its associations with pain and suffering. But all of the Swords cards carry a lesson, and the Three of Swords is no different. It lesson may be the most useful of all.@@br@@ So many things can shatter the fragility of the human heart: words, gestures, a turned back or a deaf ear. The Three of Swords is a dark gem that has many faces, none of which are particularly pleasant. There is rejection, sadness, loneliness, heartbreak, betrayal, separation and grief. Such events feel so painful because we don't expect them, and the Three of Swords often serves as a warning sign to show when one or more of these is possible. By preparing for it, the emotional blow can be lessened or even prevented entirely. But that is not the main lesson here.@@br@@ Awful as it may sound, pain is often necessary in your life. If there was no pain there would be no challenge and life would be ultimately pointless. Pain is a great motivator because it encourages you to surmount obstacles and return your life to the way it was before. Such challenges are inevitably opportunities to learn from your mistakes and grow stronger because of their teachings. The pain may cloud your vision for a time, but it the end it will allow you to see clearly, and to put the past behind you. Life will always go on, no matter how bleak it feels.@@br@@ If you can start seeing pain as an opportunity to expand and learn, life will suddenly become a whole lot less painful. The challenges remain but once they are no longer perceived as negative and evil, they lose a lot of their impact and their potency. When the Three of Swords appears and it is not in reference to an event, it is likely telling you that you have the ability to conquer any pain that comes your way. And here's how: see if the pain can help you grow. If someone has betrayed you and you don't think you can ever love again, challenge that belief wholeheartedly. Don't be surprised when your heart emerges from darkness, even more capable of loving than before. @@br@@ "},
{"image_path":"Swords04.jpg","description":"In a suit filled with strife and obstacles, the calm serenity of the Four of Swords seems somewhat out of place. This is because the Swords suit deals mainly with the negative and agressive uses of the inherent power of the sword symbol, while the Four is the only card that deals with its positive aspects of peace and mental clarity. The Four of Swords shows a period of rest and recovery after a time of challenge, with the promise that, once recovered, you will return to the challenge. In the meantime, the Four of Swords provides a tough new challenge - the challenge to stay silent.@@br@@ Think about the great stories of our time, and you will see that after every crisis - and before every new ordeal - there is always a time of relaxation. Constant tension will break even the hardest hero, but brief periods of rest enable him to \run the gauntlet\ and defeat several opponents in succession. These rests should be used wisely, to heal the body and ready the mind for the next ordeal. The power of the Swords suit can be used to heal as well as to hurt, so tap that power to soothe your injuries and clear your mind of confusion and doubt. Slip away from your problems for a while; they'll still be there when you return.@@br@@ When the Four of Swords appears it is a sign that you can stop worrying, put down your arms and lower your shield. For the moment there is a truce, and you can catch your breath without being attacked again. But always bear in mind that a truce and peace are not the same thing. The Four of Swords is a guarantee that danger will return to us as soon as we are ready to face it. So make the most of the stillness and quiet you have earned, but never lose sight of the fact that the battle is not yet over, and that there is still work to be done before the storm will pass.@@br@@ The eye of the hurricane is an appropriate symbol for the Four of Swords, since it shows a period of stillness and peace within the midst of great destruction and wrath. When the eye of the storm passes overhead, you know that the wind and rain will return soon, and the worst is still to come. But you can also reassure yourself that you have come to the halfway point of the ordeal and, if you have made it this far, surely you can hang in there until the end. Enjoy your strength and enjoy the peace you find yourself in, but be ready to batten down the hatches when the storm returns! @@br@@ "},
{"image_path":"Swords05.jpg","description":"Upon emerging from the rest of the Four we find ourselves back in the thick of conflict on the Five of Swords. The image on the Rider-Waite and its many variants is that of a victorious man and two defeated opponents, and in this symbolism we see more of the typical duality of the Swords suit. When this card appears it usually means that you are defeated - cheated out of victory by a vily and cunning opponent. But sometimes you are that victor, the one who has defeated your opponents through the use of your mind. Whether the victory was an ethical one remains to be seen.@@br@@ But let us return to the theme of defeat, which is the primary meaning of the Five of Swords. This is perhaps why the card is so unwelcome in readings; it shows that, despite your best efforts, you are likely to be beaten. But the Five of Swords is not only about being defeated and disappointed because of that defeat. If you allow yourself to become disillusioned after such a loss then you are on the path to greater ruin. Take defeat, learn from it, and then try again to succeed. It has been said that a good man will be beaten, and accept losing - but a great man will be beaten, then go back and win.@@br@@ When the Five of Swords appears and you feel that you are on the winning side this time, there is still a warning to heed. Arrogance and pride often come hand in hand with a difficult victory such as this, and you must be careful not to think you are invincible. You have overcome a challenge, and you have the right to feel proud, but know that there will be other foes to face and that some of them will eventually defeat you. Declaring your invincibility is an invitation for someone to prove you wrong. If your victory was won through cheating or unethical conduct, beware of an attempt at vengeance.@@br@@ An interesting facet of this card is revealed by symbolism in the Rider-Waite scene. It shows a man with two swords lying at his feet - the spoils of his victory. But he already had three swords, and his trophies really represent nothing more than a hollow victory. It is plausible that the two \defeated\ men were really not defeated at all; they simply laid down their arms and walked away. They either knew they would lose, or they knew winning would be a pointless exercise. And by choosing not to fight, they are really the winners here, because he who knows when to fight, and when not to fight, will be victorious. @@br@@ "},
{"image_path":"Swords06.jpg","description":"The second lesson spoken of in the Five of Swords is brought into complete manifestation in the Six of Swords. Sometimes the only way to solve life's problems is to leave them, go someplace new and start over. Though such a retreat can seem cowardly and even illogical (which would violate the Swords ideal of honesty and mental clarity) it is often the only approach left when all others have failed. After times of dreadful confusion and strife, the Six of Swords shows you that the only way to escape the turbulent waters of our emotions may be to leave them behind.@@br@@ The almost universal nautical symbolism of the Six of Swords shows that this is not only a time to get away from problems, but to chart a new course that will hopefully lead to greater happiness and glory. The mental clarity of the Swords suit is easily put to use here, and before you completely move away from a situation, the Six of Swords shows the necessity to take a look at where you've been and where you're going. This mental clarity will also serve to smooth the way ahead, and make the passage from negative to positive as peaceful as possible. Though the waters behind are choppy, there are no rough seas ahead to slow your progress.@@br@@ The symbolism of the swords stuck in the boat denotes the power of a rational mind over the heart and the intuition, but not in the same way as the Three of Swords did. The control on that card was swift and brutal; here it is more passive and sometimes even welcomed after drawn-out emotional conflict. While there is often an aura of depression and sadness associated with the Six, such a transition from a negative venue to a more positive one should be seen as cause for celebration and joy. It is only when you cling to the past that the necessity of moving on into the future will cause pain.@@br@@ Instead of ruling the emotions, the Six of Swords actually offers a highly controlled balance of logic and intuition. This is how true mental clarity arises; you can use your intuition to guide you through easy situations and call upon your impartial and analytical nature when it is needed for a more complex decision. Do not seek to suppress your emotions any more than a sea captain would want to eliminate the water. Rather, respect their presence and their power in your life, and use them to your advantage. When a balance between head and heart is achieved, truly great things can be accomplished. @@br@@ "},
{"image_path":"Swords07.jpg","description":"Stealing from anyone is a risky exercise, but stealing from someone who has both the ability and the motivation to punish you - such as the inhabitants of the military camp on the Seven of Swords - is often downright foolish. Such cunning and confidence are two of the hallmarks of the Seven of Swords, as it stands for those times when guile and diplomacy will bring about the results that brute force will not. But the Seven of Swords has that same double edge as the rest of the cards in its suit, and thus it implies that you can be the victim of such deception.@@br@@ Whether or not the outcome is successful, the Seven of Swords usually refers to plans in which deception or guile is a key factor. This is the card of the con artist, the thief and the trickster. All of these types of people usually work alone, fearing that the incompetence of others will interfere with their work. Hence they develop a kind of \Lone Wolf\ mentality which could eventually prove detrimental. On the Rider-Waite card, the man cannot carry all of the swords and must leave two of them behind. By implication, this is an incomplete victory, though success appears to have been achieved. @@br@@At other times the victory is not so complete. The Seven of Swords often shows or predicts a loss due to cunning and trickery. The cunning may be that of another person who cheats you out of a hard-earned victory, or who swindles your money away from you. Or it could be your own trickery that leads to your undoing. Both of these scenarios offer lessons. The unethical victory of another person should be used as a model of what to watch for in similar situations in the future. On the other hand, having your deception exposed should teach you that deception is not the best way to win!@@br@@ The last meaning of the Seven of Swords, one that is not too apparently connected with the others, is indecision. When you have to do what you felt was wrong in order to succeed, or when you do something that you thought was right but that put you in danger, your whole ethical system can be challenged and warped. If you have to compromise your values in order to achieve the goals you have set, you should either revise your ethics or re-evaluate your goals - probably the latter. Society as a whole does not look well upon the Machiavellian belief of ends justifying means. The vigilante approach of the Seven of Swords is rarely the best one. @@br@@ "},
{"image_path":"Swords08.jpg","description":"The Eight of Swords shows what happens when you abuse the power of the Swords suit to a large enough degree - it turns against you. In most cases, the Eight of Swords and its precarious position of entrapment is the end result. Your mental clarity is replaced by blindness, your arms are tied and you feel unable to move out of the situation. And if you tried to move, you would likely impale yourself on the ring of Swords. The twisted web of logic and mental power is a tough one to escape, but it can be done by someone who realizes that the Swords can be used to his or her advantage.@@br@@ This card usually indicates a time of powerlessness and restriction, and more often than not this restriction is self-imposed. You may be holding yourself back because you fear moving into the future, or because you are wary of getting hurt by a new situation, or maybe for no reason at all. In rare instances you will find that another person's action - or inaction - is what keeps you from moving forward, but most of the time the blame falls on you alone. You cannot be held back unless part of you wants to be held back. The trick is finding a way to overcome that, and free yourself from the bonds of fear and doubt.@@br@@ When the Eight of Swords appears, its purpose is not to taunt you or to tell you something you already know. The reason for its manifestation is to show you that you can escape your situation just as quickly as you put yourself into it. Look at the picture on the Rider-Waite card again. The woman's feet are not bound, and if she chose to, she could carefully walk to the closest sword and use it to cut the ropes holding her arms to her sides. At the moment she does not do this, because the same fear that got her into this situation is keeping her from escaping it.@@br@@ No matter how difficult your situation, the Eight of Swords shows that there are always options and ways to escape. You may not think they are plausible, and you may not even know they exist, but they are there waiting for you to put them to use. The key is to stop using the Swords for negative purposes. Anger, agression, haste and excessive force will only make your situation worse, so let them go and accept the mental clarity and peace that the Swords suit idealizes. With that new and perfect vision you should be able to see the way out of every problem that you encounter. @@br@@ "},
{"image_path":"Swords09.jpg","description":"It is one of the many paradoxes of human nature that a bed can both make you secure and release your inner fears to haunt you. The night often holds your greatest fears and terrors, including nightmares like the one which has woken the woman on the Nine of Swords. This card rules regret, anxiety and all the other things that make you sit in bed at all hours of the night, afraid to close your eyes and go back to sleep. Unlike the pain of the Three of Swords, which is caused by an exterior event, the Nine of Swords is a realm of inner anguish. You can run away from exterior pain, but you cannot hide from that which burns within you.@@br@@ This isn't exactly a happy card to see, because it often shows deeply rooted emotional pain that simply refuses to go away. Usually this is either guilt or regret, and in either case you feel the pain because you wish you could go back and change what happened - but you cannot. The event is not as painful as the reminder that it is your fault, and that you can do nothing about it. Only by accepting responsibility can you ever hope to defeat this anguish, and in the majority of cases submitting to the pain is worse than trying to fight it. But if you do not, it remains to terrorize and taunt you.@@br@@ Fear and apprehension often serve as magnifying lenses that distort problems that really exist in your world. You see things that aren't really there and you start jumping at shadows as if they would hurt you. In the Rider-Waite image of the Nine of Swords, only three of the swords pass near the woman's head; the others pose no threat. The Seven of Cups showed seeing solutions that that weren't there - the Nine of Swords shows what can happen when you see problems that aren't there. You inevitably become even more worried and stressed out - and you start seeing more problems.@@br@@ Most of the time, the Nine of Swords does not show what exists at the moment, but what could be if the situation continues. There is a vulnerable spot in your life that could easily be pierced by any of the nine swords - even those that aren't really there. The first thing to do, then, is to stop seeing problems that don't exist. Then you can take a look at what remains, the real problems, and defuse them before they cause you any harm. And this is not impossible - great strength may be triggered by a painful situation. You have the power to face and destroy all of your fears. @@br@@ "},
{"image_path":"Swords10.jpg","description":"All they that take the sword, it has been said, shall perish with the sword, and the Ten of Swords is a card that show us the real-life implications of this proverb. This is the ultimate manifestation of the Swords suit and its negative, destructive power. Even though only one sword would be needed to kill this man, ten were used: he has not simply been killed, but annihilated. The Ace of Swords was a warning about using excessive force for evil purposes and the Ten is the inevitable result of that abuse of power. Those who refuse to listen to the wisdom of the Swords will eventually be impaled on them.@@br@@ This card usually symbolizes a sudden and unexpected failure or disaster, a power beyond your control that humbles you without warning or mercy. Karma, the law of cause and effect, has free reign in the Ten of Swords, so a past misdeed may indeed be the source of future trouble. Sometimes you will be able to change this outcome, but most of the time you will simply have to bear down and take the hit. The positive side is that the Ten of Swords is the final ordeal, and no more pain will come to you from that source. It is darkest before the dawn, and as gloomy as it looks, the sun will rise again.@@br@@ Something that is important to note, at least in the Rider-Waite symbology, is that the sun is indeed rising in the background despite the black clouds. Each new beginning must come from another beginning's end, and with every defeat are sown the seeds of future victory. Enlightenment comes from using your mental and spiritual powers for good, and this is the true lesson of the Swords suit. This card is the ultimate teacher, and it shows you how to learn from your mistakes and misdeeds so you never have to fall prey to the evil side of the Swords suit again.@@br@@ When this card appears after a painful situation, it is a signal to pick yourself up off the ground and start thinking about what happened to you and what you have to learn from it. Hidden deep beneath the surface of the Ten of Swords is the ultimate power of the Swords suit: the ability to analyze your ways and learn from yourself. True wisdom does not come from without, but from within. The Ten of Swords is a sign that what you have gone through was not without purpose. The great positive power within you can be used to learn from your pain and draw wisdom from defeat. This is the Swords ideal. @@br@@ "},
{"image_path":"Swords11.jpg","description":"The Page of Swords has the mental outlook and philosophy of a child, and he is constantly fascinated with matters of the mind. This is not to imply by any means that he is childish and immature; indeed, he is probably the most mature and mentally developed of the four Pages. He may not realize his full power at the moment, but he knows how to use what he has discovered to the best of his ability. Like all the Pages, the Page of Swords will manifest in your life either as an event, another person or as a part of yourself that needs to be awakened.@@br@@ As an event, the Page of Swords deals with insight and perception, and use of one's inherent mental powers. Due to its assocations with subtlety and even espionage, the Page of Swords can show either the commencement of an act of spying, or the detection of a spy. \Spy\ in this sense can be taken in many ways: someone who is interested in you or in someone else, somebody who is doing research or gathering information, or in rare cases, someone who wants to do someone else harm. But since the more positive side of the Swords is inherent in the Page, this last interpretation is uncommon and only in rare cases is it not eliminated right away.@@br@@ A person shown by the Page of Swords will have a good balance between mind and heart; his emotions will not rule him but he will not have to think over every single decision he makes. He is the ideal emissary or ambassador since he seizes and exploits all opportunities that arise. He quickly adapts to changing circumstances and is gifted with eloquent speech. Unlike some of the \older\ Swords court cards, the Page always expresses his true feelings, though he is always able to camouflage his true intent if he wants to. When he decides to throw away diplomacy and call things like he sees them, prepare for a serious reality check.@@br@@ Awakening these qualities in yourself can have many advantages. The Page of Swords uses his blade to cut straight to the heart of a matter, ridding the area of cobwebs and red herrings that might lure you astray. His appearance is often a challenge, to expand your mind and look at things in new ways that you hadn't thought of before. If you have been unable to see all the aspects of a situation, the Page will show you how, and aid you in uncovering that which is less than obvious. Understand the problem that you face, and in the process of learning you will often find an answer. Expand your mind, learn how to do new things and have fun doing them. Seek out the truth, regardless of the consequences, and try to become more adept in the use of your mind. @@br@@ "},
{"image_path":"Swords12.jpg","description":"When the diplomacy of the Page of Swords fails to achieve results, the Knight will try it his way, the violent way. Violence in this sense does not refer to physical brutality but to a suddenness and apparent hostility that will threaten most people. And if they do not feel threatened they will almost certainly feel a little wary around the Knight of Swords. He is the essence of the element of Air, almost completely removed from the realm of emotion, and all that is associated with him must be perceived accordingly. He can manifest in the typical three ways: as an event, as a person in your life, or as a part of yourself.@@br@@ It is rare that the Knight of Swords symbolizes an event, and when he does the event is one of two general possibilities. The first is the sudden going or coming of a matter, a quick departure or an unexpected arrival. Given the association of the Swords to politics, this could manifest as the resignation of a political leader or the start of a new campaign, for example. This is, as described, also a very violent card and the Knight of Swords can thus represent the start or the end of hostility and conflict, usually the former. This may not be a physical conflict, but a debate or an argument. Only in rare cases will it mean the start of war, but that possibility exists.@@br@@ A person represented by this card will act with almost total emotionlessness. It's not that they have no emotions, just that they suppress them and don't really see the value in having them. The heart is the center of compassion, but it is also the center of fear, and with his heart firmly under his heel, the Knight of Swords is almost totally fearless and never anticipates defeat. He thinks of himself as invincible, and though this is a fault it can also give him bursts of confidence that let him succeed where others fail. Since he never doubts himself or his ability, he is the perfect person to implement new ideas that others shy away from.@@br@@ Dangerous as it may seem to assume the personality of the Knight of Swords, sometimes it is necessary and even preferable to do so. Whenever you feel afraid or indecisive, call on the Knight of Swords to give you a shot of confidence and clarity. His impartiality is very desirable when making hard choices, though you have to be careful not to act too hastily, or else the effort is wasted. His refusal to back down from fear makes him a pillar of strength. All of his negative qualities - and there are quite a few - must be carefully monitored; otherwise they will start to rage out of control, and that's definitely not what you want. @@br@@ "},
{"image_path":"Swords13.jpg","description":"The Queen of Swords is another of those mysteriously ambiguous court cards in which the masculine and the feminine are at conflict. She never shows her emotional side, but her judgement can sometimes be swayed by her heart, and because of these conflicts she is neither a good confidante nor a fair judge. The Greek myth of Atalanta comes to mind when viewing this card (and not just because Atalanta is the Queen of Swords in the Mythic Tarot!). Atalanta was a woman who lived to the standards of men, and who would not accept the love of any man except one would could defeat her in battle. When someone did beat her, their love was squandered and destroyed.@@br@@ Most of the time, the Queen of Swords shows a person in your life. Such a person is always renowned for their perception and insight. The intuitive quality of the Water element and the mental clarity of the Swords are behind this potent combination, and in this case the two elements are not opposite to one another. This keen vision allows the Queen of Swords to see straight to the heart of any situation, past the illusions that may entice others into seeing what isn't really there. She always sees both sides of every argument and those who try to deceive her are in for a big surprise - thieves and con artists will quickly taste her cold steel.@@br@@ The negative side of the Queen of Swords stems in part from her honesty and desire for the truth. Once she has a view of the situation she lets everyone involved know her opinion, and heaven help them if they disagree! Her mind is as sharp as a razor and when it is not occupied slicing away lies, it will start to cut the perceived liars. This type of person often has very few friends, and they are often depressed and unsatisfied with themselves because they cannot live up to their own high standards. The Queen of Swords often uses her dry and vicious humor to keep others from seeing her bitterness and her dissatisfaction.@@br@@ Each of us is a bit like the Queen of Swords, some more than others. Often, her ability to perceive the truth despite a web of lies will prove useful if there are hints of deception. Tapping the power of the Queen of Swords will help you see what is being hidden, if anything. Her stoicism and her \stiff upper lip\ are a sign that she considers painful experiences to be learning experiences, and that you should start thinking this way too. She learns a little from everything she does and from everyone she meets, and everyone who talks with her goes away a little wiser - whether they realize it or not! @@br@@ "},
{"image_path":"Swords14.jpg","description":"The best judge of them all is the King of Swords, because he can take any situation, look at it with total impartiality, and then render a decision that is both fair and insightful. He has powerful emotions, much more so than the other Swords court cards, but he keeps them under control and uses them for the best possible purposes. The King of Swords is the figurehead of government, law, administration and all the duties associated with his suit. In the majority of cases he appears in your life as another person, though sometimes he is a part of yourself that must be brought to the surface.@@br@@ A King of Swords is a man of the highest ethical standards. He is totally incorruptible, a pillar of strength who gives sound advice to everyone, no matter who they are. Though not the same as the King of Wands, the King of Swords is a leader in his own way. His command style is more like a general than a governor. He does not inspire people, he commands them, and they obey him because they trust him. His decisions are almost always the right ones, because he sees the big picture and never lets his heart sway his judgement. Though they might not benefit the King directly, his decisions are always in everyone's best interests.@@br@@ But the King of Swords is not a passive leader who sits back and gives orders while never doing anything himself. All generals were soldiers once, and the King is no exception. He is very active, and when he thinks it is necessary his will be the blade that draws first blood. This is especially true when someone commits an act that goes against the King of Swords' ethics. He is totally intolerant of those who break the law (or rather, those who break his law) and his retribution is swift and severe. He has no real empathy for others, and he does not care for their well-being. He leads them not because he wants to, but simply because he can.@@br@@ When this part of you starts to manifest you'll know it right away. The King of Swords' arrival in your life is an event that almost never goes unnoticed simply because he commands attention from everyone around him. He does not linger waiting for something to do; he appears only when he is needed to drive raging emotions from you, or when his impartiality and cold judgement will help you solve a problem. For a moment, your head is clear and you can see things in a different light. Problems which refused to be solved before may simply solve themselves rather than stand before the King of Swords. Judge fairly, speak truth, and never waver from your standards. @@br@@ "},
{"image_path":"Wands01.jpg","description":"The Ace of Wands is the initial burst of creativity and outpouring of energy that energizes a project and inspires people to greatness. This is the spark that starts the fire, and though it cannot tell us whether the fire will burn brightly or fizzle out, its power remains. The symbology of the castle and the river on the Rider-Waite variants tells you that the Ace of Wands is like a torch that can guide you to success. However, you must be willing to carry the torch with you as you travel along that winding stream to happiness. The Ace cannot tell you where to go, but it can light your way so you can make the correct choices yourself.@@br@@ The Ace of Wands is a good card to see when you are considering a new project that requires speed and boldness. Its appearance is a sign that now is the time to act to achieve the success you desire. You have the skill to start an adventure, and the potential to see it through to its conclusion, whatever that may be. In addition to adventures in the material world, the Ace of Wands can also refer to the start of a pregnancy or the birth of a child. Since the birth of children is the ultimate demonstration of creative power, it makes sense that this event is ruled by the Wands suit.@@br@@ Wands are also the suit of health and vitality, and the Ace of Wands often brings with it a wave of fresh power and initiative. Old illnesses can just fall away under the light of this card, and the boost of power you get from that should be used immediately. If there is something you have been wanting to do, but were afraid, now is the time to feel the fear and do it anyway. You'll find it much easier to complete the things that you have to do and get to try some of the things you've been wanting to do. Enjoy every iota of the Ace of Wands' energy.@@br@@ The one drawback to the Ace of Wands is that its force is very unpredictable, and it cannot really be controlled. Like the Fire element it rules, the Ace can sometimes be used to help us, but at other times it rages out of control. And this energy cannot be invoked magically; either you have it or you don't. But those who do have it live life like no other, because they have enough confidence and fiery energy to see them through any battle. Whenever the Ace of Wands appears for you, seize the opportunity and use its energy to your highest benefit. You can achieve whatever your Will desires. @@br@@ "},
{"image_path":"Wands02.jpg","description":"After the initial power of the Ace enters your life, that power must be shaped and directed towards the area in your life where it will be most useful. This is the energy of the Two of Wands, a card of applied power. A cohesive vision of the final destination starts to form, and though this first impression may be incorrect, that really does not matter at this time. There will be plenty of time to change your course later if you are not heading in the direction you want to be. What is important now is to get moving towards your goals, whatever those are.@@br@@ This card deals a lot with the power of the Will to accomplish great things in the world. Without the initial vision there can be no final success, and without determination the goal can never be reached. The Two of Wands is a card that embodies that determination to go out into the world and succeed. It is much the same as the Magician's power, so the color scheme of the Two of Wands often resembles the Magician's. On the Rider-Waite version, the red and white flowers on the stone tile match the Magician's robes. This is the energy of the Magician brought down to a more manageable level, a level at which you can direct its course.@@br@@ When this card's energy enters your life, you will find the ability to make your dreams into reality, to achieve your highest ambitions. Now is the time to understand how we create our own reality every second of our lives. It is also time to learn how we can use that to our advantage. Boldness and daring are unlimited when this energy is under your control, so go into the world and show your power to everyone. All of the Twos are associated with unions, and the Two of Wands can show that it is a good time for friendships, but beware of relationships where all the power lies in the hands of one person. @@br@@ Personal power is another theme of this card. The Two of Wands is a reminder that we are always in control of our lives, and though we may be surprised by events from time to time, the reins remain in our hands waiting for us to use them. This is why it's important to plan ahead, and know where you are headed before you set off on your journey. There is no place for uncertainty and hesitation, but fortunately, this card gives you the energy to rid yourself of those. You deserve to be the creator and the ruler of your life. Allow your inner power to show itself - you'll be surprised by what you accomplish, @@br@@ "},
{"image_path":"Wands03.jpg","description":"It seems appropriate that the Three of Wands has three main interpretations, all of which seem to stand alone but which ultimately relate to each other. The first of these is established strength; success after initial hardship and difficulty. Partnership and teamwork is the second theme, particularly leadership in creative environments. This card also deals with personal virtue and respect for oneself. It shows that, when the chips are down and your have no one to help you and, you can turn to yourself for support and you will never be let down.@@br@@ The symbolism of the solitary man on the cliff, shown in most of the Rider- Waite variants, holds the key to all three of these meanings. Clearly he has a stable position; he holds the high ground, and he has three sturdy Wands to lean against. Indeed, even now he is leaning against one of them for support after his long journey up the mountain. The ships generally shown on the water are his own fleet, and a confirmation of the established strength. From here it is implied that a new action will lead to more success. If you are in a position of strength, secure that position and enjoy the success it will surely bring you.@@br@@ The theme of partnership might not be so easily visible in the symbolism of the solitary man. But this man has clearly travelled a long distance to see the ocean, and now that he has made the journey himself he will likely go back and find others to travel with him next time. If further success in a creative affair is desired, it often becomes necessary to ask other people for assistance. There is no shame in asking for help, but there is shame in not asking because that is the sign of a coward. Sometimes this card will predict a romantic partnership, but only if the relationship has a solid foundation and the two people involved share ideas freely.@@br@@ The last meaning is this card is the most powerful. The man has travelled this distance alone and, though he knows he will bring others with him in the future, no one can take away the fact that he made the journey himself. Your own virtue and accomplishments are also things that can never be taken away from you; they are always there to fall back upon in your time of need. Once you know what you have to offer the world, you can start putting those skills into practice. Never let failure set you back, learn from all of your mistakes and snatch victory from the jaws of every defeat. @@br@@ "},
{"image_path":"Wands04.jpg","description":"The applied and established strength of the Two and Three leads to the first stage of completion and rest, shown in the Four of Wands. This is a time to look back on all that you have done and be glad that you have done it. This would seem to very many people like a wholly positive card, but there is a conflict between the dynamic expansion of the Wands and the very restrictive and limiting numnber four. This shows primarily that, while success can be enjoyed for a while, you cannot rest on your laurels. You must never stop growing, learning, and living.@@br@@ This card can celebrate many things that are appropriate to the Wands suit; the initial success of a business venture, a good start at a creative project or the blossoming of a friendship or relationship. Marriage and childbirth are often predicted by an appearance by this card. Encompassing all of these ideas is the maxim that hard work pays off in the end, and the Four of Wands is the card of rewards for those who've worked to the best of their ability. The Four of Wands has strong ties, surprisingly enough, to Justice, because it shows that hard work is rewarded, in the end.@@br@@ This card is also tied to Justice in another way, because it shows the strong establishment of order. The Four of Wands shows the easy and natural flow of a life in balance, and it challenges you to go out and create such a balanced lifestyle for yourself. This card also defines the end of a cycle and the start of the next, and this can be proven with a bit of symbology. In the Rider-Waite deck, the castle that was sought in the Ace is now the scene of the celebration. The Four therefore shows a time when it appears you have achieved the goal that you set for yourself.@@br@@ Or have you? As mentioned, the nature of fire is to constantly keep growing into new territories, but for now the creative urge has died down. When there is success but no urge to move on, the situation could slip into a state of laziness and even decadence. Work will have to begin again, and this work must be energized with another burst of energy. If you are wise, you would take the emotional \high\ that has been generated by this time of celebration and divert it back into your work to power the next inevitable phase of growth. Enjoy the party, but keep an eye on the clock, and be ready to leave when you have to. @@br@@ "},
{"image_path":"Wands05.jpg","description":"The Five of Wands shows two types of conflict - outer and inner. The former arises when the world around you is filled with hassles and minor obstacles that would not slow your progress alone, but, when combined, they become increasingly difficult to overcome. The latter meaning manifests in times of difficult ethical choices, when the head fights the heart and when both are in combat with the conscience, each trying to tell you the best way to act and the right thing to do. It can indeed seem that you are being held back and attacked from all sides in such times.@@br@@ When an outer battle is signaled by the appearance of this card, expect several problems to crop up all at once, each demanding immediate attention and none seeming particularly easy to solve. In the Rider-Waite variants the five combatants are evenly matched and armed, because none of them are any more important that the others. The situation then becomes a lesson about setting priorities calmly and without vacillation. In the Five of Wands there is a tendency towards rashness and loss of control, and you must be careful not to let that overwhelm you.@@br@@ For inner battles marked by the Five of Wands the approach you must take is similar. Strategy is the key, because the energy of this card is natural, wild and untamed, an \every man for himself\ philosophy. In such situations, once again, a clear head will prevail where hot-headed personalities get overwhelmed by difficulties. The emphasis is now on finding the sources of inner conflict and righting the wrongs that have caused them too appear. As long as there is guilt there can be no peace. Forgiveness and repentance, in these cases, make much more powerful weapons than the thickest wand or the sharpest sword.@@br@@ The implementation of new ideas is a central theme of the Wands and the Five can show times where this implementation is halted or blocked in some way. This card may also appear when your ideas meet tough challenges by skeptics or opponents around you. At times like this, the best offense is a good defense. Hold fast to your resolve and let nothing deter you from your objectives. You will always succeed if you can tap the fiery energy of the Wands and, instead of using it for destructive purposes like fighting and quarelling, use it for constructive purposes. Compromise if you must, but refuse to lose your cool, even while standing on the hottest coals. @@br@@ "},
{"image_path":"Wands06.jpg","description":"Six is a number of balance, so it makes sense that the Six of Wands shows a time when the strife and competition of the past have been overcome, and you can enjoy the spoils of victory. This is one of the most powerful of the Minor Arcana since its meaning is so one-sided yet so full of depth at the same time. Though it is a purely physical victory that has been gained, not a spiritual one as in the Sun, that does detract from the momentary pleasure and acclaim. Not every victory must be a spiritual one - victories in the material world as just as enjoyable.@@br@@ Sometimes, when surrounded by more spiritual cards, it is true that the Six of Wands can refer to a spiritual breakthrough. But most often it refers to the surmounting of obstacles in your everyday life through confidence, quick action and dedication to your goals - the Wands ideal. When this card makes an appearance, it is a sign that your goals are about to be reached, and your hard efforts will be recognized by all. The recognition may be elaborate or subtle, but it will be there in some form. You can see all of life's battles through to their end, and what is more, you can win them too.@@br@@ As with all Wands cards, however, there are inherent dangers in playing with the Six's fire. With victory will often come pride and arrogance, and the notion that you are the best, and no one can be greater than you are. To think such things is to invite disappointment later on. While it is true that for every winner there must be a loser, it is also true that, on the average, you will lose just as often as you win. Always keep in mind, when this card's energy empowers you, how you would feel if someone made you feel inferior. Rein in your ego and make your victory all the sweeter.@@br@@ Sometimes the Six of Wands indicates the successful formation of a friendship or a romantic relationship, tending to favor the former because the Wands suit tends to focus on morality more than emotion. It is a sign to relax and enjoy the fruits of one's labors. But under no circumstances is it a shady tree under which to sit down and fall asleep. The most important work still lies ahead. This is a reminder that you are on the right track, but that there is still a long way to go. So travel in confidence and high spirits, knowing that when you do reach your destination the reception you receive will be one worthy of a king. @@br@@ "},
{"image_path":"Wands07.jpg","description":"This card teaches not only the value of courage, but the value of fear in your everday life. The Seven of Wands in the Rider-Waite variants is shown as a battle, but not one like the Five of Wands where there is no strategy and no cohesion. On the Seven, one man stands tall against all comers, and he will defend his ground until the end. Surely he must be somewhat afraid in the face of six armed foes - any of us would be. But the remarkable thing about the Seven of Wands is that it gives you the power to feel your fear, use your fear and thereby conquer your fear.@@br@@ Or to use a more modern phrase, the Seven of Wands shows that now is time to feel the fear, and do it anyway. By facing your fears and turning them to your advantage, you grow even stronger, and ready to face the next obstacle in your path. Indeed, there can be no courage without fear to inspire it. That fear does not need to be your master any more. If an opportunity calls you, cast away your doubt and go for it with courage in your hands. If you feel that now is the time to take a step towards your dream, throw hesitation to the winds and let nothing stand in your way.@@br@@ The appearance of the Seven of Wands can often be a reminder that you must stand up for yourself and for what you believe in. At times like this it is important to know exactly where you stand, or else you might end up fighting against yourself! So, before you charge off to battle, take a moment to see exactly what it is you are fighting for. The hill is not only a defensive position but a good survey ledge too. If you see that the cause is worthy and your position is stable, proceed with confidence. If you think fighting is not needed, then don't fight, for he who knows when not to fight is often he who will be victorious.@@br@@ Like the figure on the card, the Seven of Wands often shows that you hold the moral \high ground\ and your arguments are the right one, despite the sheer numbers of people who try to convince you otherwise. Though the odds may seem insurmountable, recall that the advantage always goes to the defender who knows his position better than the enemy does. Hold your ground, because victory will be yours eventually. Inner courage is a force far stronger than physical strength, and a determined combatant can often withstand the attacks of others as long as he needs to. @@br@@ "},
{"image_path":"Wands08.jpg","description":"The Eight of Wands is a strange and powerful card, because on many of the decks where the Minor Arcana show picture scenes, there is still nothing on this particular card but the Eight Wands. There are no human figures on the card, and in this aspect only the Aces and the Wheel of Fortune stands with it. (And perhaps the Three of Swords, though this card often shows a heart.) It should come as little surprise that the energy of the Eight of Wands is a swift and rapid one, not that different from the Ace of Wands or even the powerful Wheel of Fortune.@@br@@ Generally this card refers to swift and decisive action, in the form of a sudden release of energy. This burst of power clears away confusion and negativity, opening up lines of communicaton and starting events in motion. It's like the wind of a hurricane, that throws everything out of its path. Obstacles will be swept our of your path and you will be free to advance as fast as you like. Beware, though, of becoming too hasty and impetuous, for that is the warning of the Eight of Wands. Action can be quick and still well-thought, but it cannot be hasty if it is to have an effect on the world. @@br@@ So take things in stride, but hold nothing back. If there have been major obstacles in your way, you now have the power to get rid of them - either by the new energy within you or by the communication skills that this card gives you. So go looking for stubborn problems and see just how many you can solve now. On some cards, the descending staves may bring to mind Cupid's arrows, which bring about love in whoever they strike. The Eight of Wands can therefore signal the swift beginning of a romance, where someone is swept off their feet by a charming new friend. The cautions against hastiness apply here as well; go at a pace both of you are comfortable with.@@br@@ This card also reminds many of Moses' staff, which was a conduit for divine power. The Eight of Wands therefore rules over quick transformations and changes, particularly of the spiritual sort. These eight wands can serve as lightning rods to tap the power you need and attract it to you. When struck by the spiritual lightning found in such cards as the High Priestess and the Star, the Eight of Wands can be the starting point of a major spiritual and ideological transformation. All the pieces of your life will seemingly fall into place and you will see the big picture for the first time. @@br@@ "},
{"image_path":"Wands09.jpg","description":"Inner strength, stamina, and the will to go on despite impossible odds are at the center of the Nine of Wands. But this is not the same card of static defense that is found in the Seven of Wands. The Nine of Wands is more of a dynamic defense, and thus it is much more powerful. Crowley pointed out that this card illustrates the aphorism \change is stability\. In times of great difficulty and stress, this card show us that you will always have strength to endure if you search for it deep inside of yourself.@@br@@ You should expect difficulty when this card appears, but you should also expect to find a way to overcome it. Keep your power at the ready and be vigilant for opposition, always ready to defeat it. Identify your own power and be ready to use it in your defense. You should be aware, though, that combat is not always the best answer. Often, waiting is the only way to bring about victory. Beware also of waiting so long that you are still ready to fight long after the conflict has ended. It is often hard to tell whether a period of calm marks the beginning, middle, or the end of a storm. Holding on is admirable, but sometimes it is even more remarkable to let go.@@br@@ This card often marks the final ordeal, the last hill that must be climbed or the last hurdle that must be cleared before the finish line. And it is the last obstacle that usually proves most dangerous, because it is a last ditch effort by whatever forces oppose you to stop you before you reach your goal at last. To surmount this obstacle you have to realize but one thing. You have made it this far, and this obstacle is no different that the others you have already defeated. Great glory lies ahead, so reach down deep inside and give it everything you've got.@@br@@ Such strength can be found in everyone, though for some reason it only shows itself to us when we need it. The strength to proceed against all odds is not a force that can be invoked, but that must be earned through adversity and challenges of all sorts. It is only available when every other option has been explored, when every stone has been turned, when the fuel gauge is teetering on empty but you still want to try one more time. Then, admist the greatest of darknesses, your inner strength starts to shine, lighting the way to glory. And how brightly that light can shine when you need it to! @@br@@ "},
{"image_path":"Wands10.jpg","description":"It may seem odd that the suit of Wands ends not with the same fiery energy that it started out with, but with almost a complete opposite of that energy. The Ace of Wands was quick and unrestrained, but the Ten shows the weight of burdens upon one's shoulders. Where the rest of the Wands dealt with the creative expression and use of one's willpower, on the Ten this power is blocked, and you are forced to live under someone else's will rather than your own. But there is a logical explanation for this card's appearance at the end of the Wands suit.@@br@@ We must always keep in mind that fire is, at its basest level, a force of destruction. And when you wield the power of fire for long enough, you are going to get burned, as inevitably as the fire will spend its fuel and be reduced to a few glowing embers. The wise rule and well-used power of the previous cards have gone out of control and have become tyranny; the desire to succeed and the determination to go forward with your head held high has left, and now you must stumble or crawl. In a more Qabalistic sense, the energy has been detatched from its spiritual source and has become corrupt.@@br@@ However, sometimes this process shown in the Ten of Wands is a lesson that you must learn. Responsibility is a great character-builder, and by bearing physical burdens you often find that emotional burdens will fall away. You will lose your ego when you ask for help, and you will lose your limitations as you reach and surpass them. But you also have to learn when enough is enough, and when it is time to get out from under your burdens. When your creativity starts to suffer it may never regain its original dimensions again, and once creativity is gone, the will is next to go.@@br@@ Sometimes the Ten of Wands is a good card to appear, because it can indicate where you are spinning your wheels and wasting your energy. It is often a sign that, no matter how long you stick to a task, victory is unlikely or even impossible. In these circumstances the best advice is to simply walk away. Leaving responsibilities unfinished is not a notion that appears to coalesce with the overall morality of the Wands suit, but sometimes doing what you have to do is far more necessary than doing what you'd like to do. So go out there, do what you have to do, and hopefully you can get a little closer to those things that you want to do. @@br@@ "},
{"image_path":"Wands11.jpg","description":"The Page of Wands has a passion for life, despite the fact (or maybe because of the fact) that he is still a child and his understanding of the world is not yet complete. He is a free spirit, not weighed down by the burdens of the material world, coming and going as he pleases, usually bringing change along for the ride. He is the catalyst that provokes changes that might be impossible in any other situation. When his energy enters your life it may manifest in one of three ways: as a person around you, as an event that you will experience, or as a part of yourself that you must bring to the fore. @@br@@ Only rarely is an external event signalled by the Page of Wands. He does act as a herald for the same activites as the other pages; the arrival of good news and the birth of children, for example. And in those cases he is a very good sign, particularly in the latter case because of his association with creation and conception. But the event he usually symbolizes is a different type of conception, the conception of an idea. The Page of Wands represents the brief creative spark that comes to you, suddenly and unexpectedly, and that starts you down the road of a new creative vision. Your life will never be the same once he comes into it.@@br@@ Sometimes this spark will appear in your life as a person who embodies the physical or mental qualities of the Page of Wands. Such a person often has a vivid and childlike imagination, though they may neither realize it is there or know how to develop it for creative purposes. As such his ambitions are high but not unattainable; he will challenge himself but he will probably not overstep his limits unless pushed to do so. As a Wands card, ethics are always high on his list of priorities. He accepts change because he is the agent of change, the catalyst and the creative visionary. He is also a faithful lover with almost unlimited passion and enthusiasm.@@br@@ There is, of course, a Page of Wands lying within each of us waiting for a chance to manifest (if it is not doing so already!). When he does appear in your life it often comes at a time when you need his passion for life and his total fearlessness. His greatest power, in fact, is the power to deal with fears by facing them and seeing them for what they are. The light of his inner fire can expose the dark demons that you have been so afraid of, and show you that what you were running from was yourself all along. Once you see that your fears are nothing but parts of you, you can integrate them into yourself and grow stronger. Leave your fear behind and you'll be surprised how much freedom you'll win. @@br@@ "},
{"image_path":"Wands12.jpg","description":"There is no card in the Tarot that portrays such daring and enthusiasm as the Knight of Wands. His energy and courage are boundless, and he has no fear of anything; while this sometimes serves to get him into trouble, these are also the means by which he can free himself from any detrimental situation. There are few times when he does not move with the speed of a flash of lightning. When he rides into the area he always kicks up dust behind him, and when he enters your life he can be one of three things. He could be a person around you, an event that you will experience, or a part of yourself that you must bring to the surface.@@br@@ Any event that enters your life quickly and unexpectedly is generally ruled and predicted by the Knight of Wands. His energy moves with the speed of a raging fire pushed onward by the wind, and with just as much energy as such a blaze. The Knight often represents the coming or going of an important matter, and you can rest assured that these comings and going will be swift ones, no matter what the matter involved. He also augurs speedy changes of residence, which may not be advisable but which are sometimes necessary. Sometimes he shows that an important person will be either leaving your life or coming into it.@@br@@ Such a person, when shown by the Knight of Wands, shares his spontaneity and kinetic outlook on life. Though he may seem gruff or even violent at first glance, underneath that armor he wears a warm and generous heart. He will be highly supportive of those he considers friends - and you'd be surprised how high that number can go! He typifies the \knight in shining armor\ prototype because he is always swooping into situations, saving the day and then moving on to the next adventure. This suddenness hides a deep sense of morality and honor; he is always ready to protect those who cannot defend themselves. But he cannot stand to stay in one place for long; there is always more to do.@@br@@ If the Knight of Wands shows energy within yourself that you have to bring to the surface, doing so shouldn't be very difficult. In fact, keeping it in may be harder than letting it out, so you probably shouldn't attempt to fight it at all! Your confidence levels will rise to the surface along with the Knight's energy, and you'll feel ready to take on the world. Tackle any and all challenges that come into your path, and always be ready to help others who lack your determination and exuberance. Take the torch he offers you and step into the light of your own strength. Just be careful not to burn yourself while holding that flickering flame! @@br@@ "},
{"image_path":"Wands13.jpg","description":"Something in the symbology of the Queen of Wands gives us a look into the character of this charming but elusive woman. She is almost universally pictured with a cat, and this feline companion represents Venus in both its creative and sinister aspects. Thus the Queen of Wands is someone who can use for fire energy for good or evil; almost a Swords notion. Her innate Water form and the Fire of her suit cancel out, leaving her very Airy. This energy can appear as a person or as a part of yourself. She hardly ever represents an event in one's life.@@br@@ The person who takes after the Queen of Wands will know what they want in life, and they will go after it whenever they get the opportunity. Such a person cannot be swayed from their goals, no matter how strong the forces opposing them. She is independent but has a lot of friends - in fact, she is almost always the center of attention of a large group. Her charisma and enthusiasm tends to attract others to her. And that's not all people are attracted to - the Queen tends to be a very sexy and sensual woman, despite being by far the most masculine of the Queens. Such are the contradictions inherent in this fiery and ambitious woman!@@br@@ But there is that negativity factor talked about earlier left to consider. Her sutbbornness will often lead to her detriment as she pursues an ambition for too long and burns herself out in the process. Even the Queen of Wands is not invincible, though from her general outlook on life she might seem to be, and she definitely believes she is. She always has to be on the move, and she will not tolerate anything that makes her stay somewhere for longer than she wants to. Often she takes others' problems into her own hands to see them solved more quickly, and in fragile situations this can cause more problems than it solves. In general, she would make a great friend, but a very dangerous enemy.@@br@@ Having these qualities within yourself might seem a little dangerous too, but everyone has a bit of the Queen of Wands inside them. When she appears it is often time to bring these qualities into manifestation in your life. Her constancy and dedication will surely be an aid if you have a creative vision that needs to be carried out, and her innate magnetism will draw to you all the allies and friends that you need. If people call on your strength then be ready to give it; if people ask your guidance, do not hesitate to speak your mind. Engage tough issues with all your might, and do not relent until the day is won. @@br@@ "},
{"image_path":"Wands14.jpg","description":"The King of Wands is pure fire energy, but strangely enough, he has the least to do with actual creation and creativity. His forte is not in dreaming up ideas and implementing them himself, but in taking an idea and changing the world to match his vision. As such he is a natural leader and commander of all kinds of people. They flock to him to hear what he has to say and leave just as eagerly when he gives them something to do for him. Like the rest of the Kings, the ruler of the Wands suit will appear in two ways in your life: either as a person or as a part of yourself that must be awakened.@@br@@ As a person, the King of Wands is the ultimate leader, who looks forward to challenges because he enjoys the rush of adrenalin that solving a difficult problem can induce. He not only dispels his own fear but that of others, by ensuring them that they shall succeed. He is not all talk, though; when the going gets tough no one hangs in there longer than he does. The King of Wands has a deep and innate respect for other people, and his compassion extends farther than most people would expect. For a King, he has a remarkably good relationship with the common people. When he is unable to assist by himself, he will empower and enable others to help in his place.@@br@@ As with all of us, the King's faults emerge from his strengths. Most of the time he does not show enough restraint to know when assistance is not needed or wanted. He can sometimes make things even worse by doing what he thinks is the right thing - and he always thinks that what he is doing is the right thing. Most of the time his high sense of ethics proves him right, but in those few times where he is on the wrong side of the argument, he can do more harm than good. But one thing that can never be said of him is that he walks away from problems, whatever they are. He will defend another man just as vigilantly, if not more so, than he would protect himself.@@br@@ An inner spiritual change is often heralded when this card appears. The King of Wands invites us to act as he would to solve our problems. His vision is one of ideal reality, and his vision is that humanity might always be better than it is. He is the warrior of light who stands up for something that matters, and his appearance is an invitation for you to do so as well. If there is a cause you wish to support, but you are unsure of your position, you may proceed with the knowledge that your base of power is strong. Enjoy the King's power and authority, but be sure to use it for productive means. Take your responsibilities seriously, think of new ways to do things, and never stop believing in yourself. @@br@@ "}
